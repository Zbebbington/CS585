michelle and i are heartbroken for everybody who‚Äôs lost so much in california, and grateful for the heroism of the firefighters who‚Äôve been risking their lives around the clock to save others. please do what you can to help our fellow americans in need: https://t.co/13rm1d6rwk

to all our veterans and your families: thank you. there's no tribute that can truly match the magnitude of your service and sacrifice. but all of us can do our best to live up to the american values of service, responsibility, generosity, and citizenship that you helped defend.

congratulations to everybody who showed up and participated in our democracy in record numbers yesterday. the change we need won‚Äôt come from one election alone ‚Äì but it is a start. last night, voters across the country started it. https://t.co/gnk4wkejun

today is the day. today, it‚Äôs your turn to raise your voice to change the course of this country for the better. so make it count. get out there and vote. go to https://t.co/nkxrgngbzx or call 833-336-vote to confirm where you can vote and check voting hours. https://t.co/6xdmbkhwkr

if you take that power and vote, something powerful happens. change happens. hope happens. and with each new step we take in the direction of fairness, and justice, and equality, and opportunity, hope spreads. go vote! https://t.co/nkxrgngbzx

when you vote, you have the power to make it easier for a student to afford college, and harder for a disturbed person to shoot up a classroom. when you vote, you have the power to make sure a family keeps its health insurance.

when you vote, you have the power to protect voting rights. to make sure our criminal justice system treats everyone equally under the law. to strengthen laws that protect women in the workplace from harassment ‚Äì and make sure they‚Äôre paid equally.

when we've been at such crossroads before, americans have made the right choice. not because we sat back and waited for history to happen -- but because we marched, and mobilized, and voted. we made history happen.

tomorrow‚Äôs elections might be the most important of our lifetimes. the health care of millions is on the ballot. making sure working families get a fair shake is on the ballot. the character of our country is on the ballot.

speaking of preexisting conditions, open enrollment starts today. if you or someone you know needs health care, visit https://t.co/ob1ynoesod. thanks to financial help, most people can find plans for $75/month or less, so check out your options and find a plan that works for you. https://t.co/r52x9sgkbp

elections matter. you have the power to protect a family‚Äôs health care. make a plan, grab some friends, and vote: https://t.co/ry8ip1km9p

those protections and your health care are absolutely at stake on tuesday. vote for democrats who‚Äôll protect them. https://t.co/bddmy60u8k

not sure who and what you can vote for? head over to https://t.co/shxg6ael0o to look up your state, learn who's running to represent you, which measures you can help decide, and more. read up, and get ready to vote on november 6.

your vote can decide the health care of millions. your voice can determine the character of our country. you have power ‚Äî use it! in most states, you don't even have to wait until election day to cast a ballot. find out where you can vote before nov. 6: https://t.co/nkxrgngbzx https://t.co/hwkfhqi49k

we grieve for the americans murdered in pittsburgh. all of us have to fight the rise of anti-semitism and hateful rhetoric against those who look, love, or pray differently. and we have to stop making it so easy for those who want to harm the innocent to get their hands on a gun.

the last presidential election turned on fewer than 100,000 votes in three states. more people go to coachella. there‚Äôs no good excuse not to vote. head over to https://t.co/ztcemnrmyv to check your registration, get your absentee ballot, and find out where to vote on november 6. https://t.co/liqbltvjtz

billy graham was a humble servant who prayed for so many - and who, with wisdom and grace, gave hope and guidance to generations of americans.

we are grieving with parkland. but we are not powerless. caring for our kids is our first job. and until we can honestly say that we're doing enough to keep them safe from harm, including long overdue, common-sense gun safety laws that most americans want, then we have to change.

happy valentine‚Äôs day, @michelleobama. you make every day and every place better. https://t.co/awvyytr7mm

conservatives when michelle obama got kids to eat healthy: "a first lady shouldn't get this involved in politics!"

conservatives when melania trump fired a white house staffer: 

next may we‚Äôre getting both the conclusion of #gameofthrones and avengers: infinty war. be still my beating heart!

who is going to fire john kelly since john kelly can‚Äôt fire john kelly? trump clearly doesn‚Äôt have the guts to do it judging from his record of avoiding one-on-one confrontation.

stop spreading conspiracy theories without evidence, lil marco. what needs to be thrown out of florida is you. https://t.co/tz6jvr68yr

donald trump:

wouldn't honor fallen soldiers due to rain
used troops in election stunt
insulted pow mccain
hid military drinking-water crisis
won't visit afghanistan
saluted n. korean general
wants to toss out service member ballots

nobody loves the military more than this guy!

on good morning america, michelle obama throws shade at donald trump, joking that if he is qualified to be president everyone is including her 17-year-old daughter sasha. https://t.co/r9h895prvr

the good news about #amazonhq2 not coming to austin is that our traffic would've been even more brutal.

so donald trump wants homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen gone. she might have a tough time landing her next job. baby imprisoning is frowned upon by most employers.

the election of kyrsten sinema, who's openly bisexual, puts an exclamation point at the end of a "rainbow wave." a historic 150+ lgbtq candidates won in 2018.

now that democrat kyrsten sinema has officially turned a senate seat in arizona blue for the first time since 1988, the best the senate gop can do is a pickup of 2 seats despite having a dream map. far from the big win donald trump sold it as.

@ariberman as a texan, i‚Äôm ashamed but not surprised that we re-elected a person indicted on multiple felony counts as our top cop. the election was pretty close for tx, though. the small silver lining.

to democrats: only tell us if you are one of the few who isn't running for president. at this point, we'll assume everybody else is and save some time.

2015: trump says "there's nobody bigger or better at the military than i am."

2016: trump says hillary doesn't have "stamina" to be potus.

2018: trump blows off honoring the military all veterans day weekend because his lazy ass wanted to binge-watch fox news and avoid rain.

"comic books to me are fairy tales for grown-ups." - stan lee

as much of the world turns to authoritarians and nationalism, the stories lee created are more popular, and important, than ever before. reminding us that diversity is a strength and justice ultimately prevails. rip.

no clue who the democratic 2020 nominee should be yet, but here's who it shouldn't be: a trump voter. hard pass on richard ojeda.

@murtadmilli no, it's real. @snopes even fact-checked it. https://t.co/duuj8ngwbb

warning: do not get trumpy bear wet. even a drizzle will ruin his patriotism. https://t.co/msvkgcjfvt

*2020 presidential debate*

donald trump: "nobody respects the troops like i do, ok. believe me."

kamala harris: "you ditched a world war one memorial because you didn't want to have a bad hair day.‚Äù

[the crowd erupts in laughter. trump's grapefruit complexion turns beet red.]

trump insulted american firefighters risking their lives while sitting in a paris hotel suite refusing to go to a wwi memorial with other leaders because the rain would ruin his hairdo. we‚Äôre supposed to believe he‚Äôs this tough, blue-collar president who loves the troops? gtfo

thousand oaks was two days ago and already it's old news. alarming that america now instantly shrugs off mass shootings. the victims and their families deserve better.

really wish robert mueller would hurry up and give us the roger stone indictment we all know is coming before stone pulls off another brooks brothers riot during the florida recounts.

to those who say it‚Äôs not a blue wave:

most house seats gained by democrats since watergate

added 7 governors, lost zero

claimed attorneys general majority

flipped almost 400 state legislature seats

if sinema and nelson win, loss of only 1 senate seat despite brutal map

giving the presidential medal of freedom to both babe ruth and elvis in 2018 is what somebody with a first grader‚Äôs understanding of history would do. actually, that totally makes sense. nevermind.

hey, conservatives who don‚Äôt think trump giving a presidential medal of freedom to miriam adelson for being a megadonor is inappropriate, close your eyes and imagine obama giving one to george soros. hello? hello? where‚Äôd you go? did your head explode? hate it when that happens.

@lauraleefulmer @kamalaharris @betoorourke that‚Äôs the super early dream ticket! we will see how it shakes out.

trump treats every group but conservative white men like garbage, but the way he talks to and about black women is particularly appalling. a black female presidential candidate beating him in 2020 would be poetic justice.

the takeaway from arizona, florida and georgia is that republicans seem both shocked and furious that democrats are actually fighting for elections to be fair. it‚Äôs like the gop is so accustomed to getting away with it that they didn‚Äôt even see this coming.

@redistrict @juliefortx25 is what happens when great candidates meet terrible maps.

@realdonaldtrump bill nelson did not concede. also, a concession is not legally binding, just a political courtesy, something someone as selfish as donald trump would never understand.

@realdonaldtrump nonetheless, republicans are trying to steal an election in florida. it‚Äôs sort of been a party tradition ever since 2000.

@realdonaldtrump remember when trump made up a bogus presidential advisory commission on election integrity and kris kobach and pence couldn‚Äôt find any voter fraud?

@realdonaldtrump voter fraud is a myth
voter fraud is a myth
voter fraud is a myth
voter fraud is a myth
voter fraud is a myth
voter fraud is a myth
voter fraud is a myth

voter fraud is a myth

a.) it‚Äôs called actually counting all the votes. realize that is an unfamiliar concept for some red states. 

b.) all us intelligence agencies agree that putin/russia interfered in 2016. trump is sucking up to him before he sees him this weekend. https://t.co/ud1ztdianx

@yashar rightfully so!

if beto o'rourke doesn't want to run for president in 2020, he could run for the senate again vs. john cornyn. supporters wouldn't even need new yard signs. https://t.co/kj3qfnramy

@alecmacgillis this is a really smart thread. lots of solid points. honestly believe ohio is lost for dems in terms of it being a purple state. feel better long term about az, fl, ga, nc and tx.

martha maccallum of fox news actually confronted lindsey graham for saying there would be "holy hell to pay" if trump fired jeff sessions as ag. totally caught graham by surprise that it wasn't a softball question. his only response was to act like 2017 was a super long time ago. https://t.co/obanqrbspt

gop = gaslighting our people

we steal florida elections? no, you steal florida elections!

we don't cover pre-existing conditions? no, you don't cover em!

we like right-wing propaganda? no, you like fake news!

we are the racists? no, you are the ones playing identity politics!

@realdonaldtrump less than 50 credible instances of voter fraud since 2000 and over like a billion ballots cast. gtfo with this nonsense.

@thor_benson a republican president who blew up the deficit cutting taxes and botched a hurricane response.

@realdonaldtrump the only corruption law enforcement should look into is widespread gop voter suppression. from north carolina to georgia, from florida to arizona. republicans know if everyone votes they lose more often than not.

very on-brand for a republican president to try to steal florida. https://t.co/va4gn6lake

@mollyjongfast a root canal on the day junior gets indicted would still be fun. üéâ

@james1976mc the special election is in 2020.

if synema and nelson both win the senate would be 48-52 and trump would've done all that chest-thumping over a pickup of one measly seat. even if only one wins, the gop adds two seats despite having a dream 2018 map.

if you want to keep checking live kyrsten sinema-marthy mcsally vote totals, here's the az secretary of state website link: https://t.co/o7lpgdjedt

kyrsten sinema is now leading the arizona us senate race! would love to see trump's face if she pulls this off and bill nelson wins the florida recount. https://t.co/qm14zdk7d2

weird how the migrant caravan "invasion" conservatives obsessed over that supposedly included isis and ms-13 and thanos and pennywise suddenly is no longer a thing they want to talk about after election day.

"florida recount" has long been one of my least favorite phrases. thinking about the brooks brothers riot and hanging chads makes my blood boil. damn, would either an andrew gillum or bill nelson win this time around be cathartic.

@ananavarro the 2000 winner was illegitimate.

@cameron_kasky yup! unfortunately, in the state of florida, every vote counting is far from a sure thing. see: 2000.

the white house helped the gop win races with the lie that this is the era of "fake" allegations and "a very scary time" for men.

then right after the election sarah sanders makes a fake allegation to try to cost journalist jim acosta his job.

she should lose her job instead.

@cmthoma30445933 i realize that. doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt start discussing legislation now.

look, i dislike the president as much as anybody, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we shouldn‚Äôt push him on gun reform. democrats now control the house and innocent people keep dying. we gotta try. if he doesn‚Äôt go for it, and he won‚Äôt, we can say heading into 2020 that he didn‚Äôt act.

@mollyjongfast marsha blackburn is also the dana loesch of ted cruzes.

trump says he‚Äôs serious about bipartisanship with nancy pelosi. 

he claims his fortune means no special interests, like @nra, own him.

prove it!

pick up the phone right now and work with democrats on common sense gun laws to end the mass shooting epidemic. stop the bloodshed.

@zacharybest if he wasn‚Äôt a white guy she wouldn‚Äôt be making excuses like this either. it‚Äôs really effed up.

certainly don‚Äôt condone the harassment of tucker carlson or any other person in media, but this is somebody who is inciting white extremism at a time when domestic terrorism and hate crimes are spiking. what the hell did he expect to happen as a result?

think about everything ruth bader ginsburg has overcome in her life. some broken ribs aren't going to stop a feminist gladiator who shatters glass ceilings with her gavel.

@mollyjongfast i will also ditch my agnostic ways if it keeps rbg on the bench.

the actual number is $1,253,000, which was the combined total spent supporting marsha blackburn and attacking opponent phil bredesen during the tennessee us senate race. see more here (via @teamtrace): https://t.co/eoikbqygs3

senator-elect marsha blackburn gets asked about the thousand oaks mass shooting, and literally the first thing she says is "what we do is say how do make certain that we protect the 2nd amendment." this is why the nra spent over $1 million supporting her. https://t.co/wf63m0qyg7

the election was only two days ago but we‚Äôve already seen the banishment of an innocent journalist, the installation of a yes-man attorney general, the hospitalization of ruth bader ginsburg and a mass shooting at thousand oaks. our national nightmare is now moving at warp speed.

beautiful irony from the midterms:

nra darling karen handel loses to mom of gun violence victim.

baker discriminates against gay couple, now has gay governor.

scott walker's own law stops him from getting recount.

trump voter suppression guru kris kobach can't rig his state.

the movie elf was released 15 years ago today, and jeff sessions just happens to get fired on its anniversary. 

@danqdao 

wild that the two republicans who were the most prominent opponents of marijuana in the entire country share the same last name despite no relation and were ousted from dc in a 24-hour span. so long, jeff sessions and pete sessions. we'll smoke one for you when it becomes legal.

so let‚Äôs get this straight...

we all saw with our own eyes that jim acosta clearly did not assault that young woman today, yet the white house says he did. 

dr. christine blasey ford gave a credible account of brett kavanaugh assaulting her, yet the white house says he didn‚Äôt.

founding father: each state always has two senators.

time traveler: always?

ff: always!

tt: california has --

tt: it's a state now.

ff: i see.

tt: california has 70 times more people than wyoming, another state.

@drlostcauses trumpers say stuff like, sure his trade war cost me my farm but it‚Äôs what‚Äôs best for america‚Ä¶ or, i am still unemployed but he just needs a few more years to find me a job. i am paraphrasing actual quote. it‚Äôs nuts.

the most frustrating thing about republicans doing so well in rural areas is that those places are often subsidized by the big blue cities and states many rural voters seem to hate.

@bessbell @katiehill4ca katie ran an amazing campaign that people across the country took notice of. everyone who played a role in it should be proud.

house oversight committee democrats should investigate members of donald trump‚Äôs cabinet. some suggestions:

ben carson
betsy devos
kirstjen nielsen
ryan zinke
wilbur ross

if you can‚Äôt impeach trump, take down his team while exposing white house corruption and incompetence.

@conradkaz great point. a crazy development considering sessions was his first senate supporter and helped mold a lot of his ideology. crazy that republicans continue to be loyal to someone they know will backstab them eventually.

@clintsmithiii this tweet is the monument that needs to replace him. legendary.

part of this jeff sessions mess that isn't being talked about is that republicans lost a senate seat in deep-red alabama because of this decision. really blew up in their faces. with the gop picking up a few senate seats, that looks pretty big right about now.

@goldengateblond in the end, not even their shared love of racism was enough to make it work. https://t.co/trch8qabsz

jeff sessions can now retire from politics and enjoy his dream job of serving as a garden gnome outside kkk headquarters.

@canadawatching he got asked to resign, got fired, whatever, that‚Äôs not the important part here. protecting mueller is.

jeff sessions has already resigned as ag. that escalated quickly. we need to be very vocal in protecting robert mueller and the special counsel. especially with matthew whitaker and not rod rosenstein replacing sessions as acting ag.

@redistrict colin allred is going places! perhaps a future texas governor or us senator. he honestly could be the next beto here in tx.

a white house aide can't try to forcefully rip a microphone from a reporter just for asking a question the president didn't like. this isn't some banana republic where journalists like jim acosta are silenced for not being baghdad bobs.

@gaywonk ‚Äúasymmetrical polarization‚Äù is a great term to sum up how conservatives have successfully pulled our country to the right over the past 25 years.

@aynrandpaulryan what!? okay!!

@hoarsewisperer two peas in a pod.

one of the most ridiculous claims trump and republicans consistently make is that we need to ‚Äúrebuild our military.‚Äù the us military is better funded than the next 10 countries combined. we need to scale back that funding to properly fund healthcare, education and infrastructure.

@jaketapper https://t.co/ffbrfyiiwa

regardless of what the pathological liar in the oval office says, ‚Äúsuppression polls‚Äù are not an actual thing.

trump just told a whopper of a lie. 

he said that if hillary clinton continued on the obama economic trajectory, numbers would be down. 

obama‚Äôs last 21 months created more jobs than trump‚Äôs first 21 months. 

that‚Äôs a fact. go to the bureau of labor statistics and look it up.

@aynrandpaulryan that was a level up from even brett kavanaugh angry!

jim acosta is a god damn national treasure for standing up to donald trump on his racist ‚Äúmigrant caravan‚Äù strategy, and not backing down when trump tried to silence him. peter alexander, too, for picking up where acosta left off. the president completely melted down there.

@mikesheaap i really don‚Äôt agree with that. you had progressives do well in places they shouldn‚Äôt have and win quite a few races where they had never won before. maybe moderate dems did well because there are no moderate republicans left in the house? senate dem centrists kinda got crushed.

@mikesheaap colin allred and beto o‚Äôrourke did amazingly well on that message in texas. my gut is that it resonated pretty well around the country but i would like to see a geographical breakdown too.

shocking to see a sitting president shaming defeated candidates from his own party for not embracing him hard enough. he acted like he was at a comedy central roast. there has never been a human being as petty as donald j. trump.
https://t.co/irfyag6zcp

donald trump claims ‚Äúrepublicans had a dramatic fundraising disadvantage driven by democrats‚Äô wealthy donors and special interests.‚Äù that‚Äôs dead wrong. a great deal of the party refused pac money and small donors were the actual key here.

one thing all liberals should celebrate today: last night we put the final nail in the coffin of the paul ryan, reince priebus and scott walker era of wisconsin conservatism. time to get back to progressive politics there.

here mitch mcconnell goes again with his ‚Äúpresidential harassment‚Äù nonsense. democrats simply want oversight. the only "presidential harassment" going on is donald trump spewing dangerous rhetoric about his political opponents to the point he incites domestic terrorism. https://t.co/zgjmjhnd1j

76% of georgia white women voting for brian kemp over stacey abrams is so depressing. had the choice to elect a virtuous woman and overwhelmingly picked a vile man instead.

scott walker can no longer screw over the poor, the sick, women, people of color, unions, students, the lgbtq community, humans who breathe air... well, basically anybody who lives in wisconsin.

you really see the damage of gop gerrymandering when democrats win the national popular vote by 7 freakin' points and end up only winning the house of representatives by 25-30 seats. with fair maps, it's a much bigger wave.

these kinds of takes tend to piss some people off, but whatever. i honestly believe the current gop is so treacherous that all non-right-wingers have to band together to stop them wherever possible. apparently, many green party voters disagree.

@mexican_liberal dropped out very late.

looks like democrat kyrsten sinema could lose the az senate race by fewer votes than the green party candidate received. it's a pattern: greens play spoiler and end up helping the gop. this was not the time for third-party folks to make a protest vote. trump is way too dangerous.

sounds like will hurd did actually barely beat gina ortiz jones now. what a mess. has a vote-counting error ever gone democrats way? https://t.co/j3uiivuzwu

dennis hof overwhelmingly won a nevada state assembly race. conservatives would rather vote for a dead pimp than a democrat. you can't even parody right-wing america at this point. they are killing political comedy.

if what appears to be a gina ortiz jones miracle comeback win holds, tx-7, tx-23 and tx-32 will have all flipped blue. effing incredible night for texas democrats.

democrat tony evers is the new governor of wisconsin! scott walker might want to freshen up that resume because he is going back to the private sector.

yes! jacky rosen has flipped dean heller‚Äôs seat blue in nevada, the first senate flip for democrats of the night. about. damn. time.

joe cunningham pulling off the upset in #sc01 is a huge get for democrats. @fivethirtyeight gave him a 1 in 10 chance of winning.

'in a civilized nation, the machinery of democracy should work for everyone everywhere, not just in certain places, and not just on a certain day." - stacey abrams, forcefully taking on brian kemp's voter suppression as votes are still being counted in ga. https://t.co/zalfmlkocq

it looks like scott walker might lose to tony evers. don‚Äôt go to bed or you might miss the best schadenfreude of the midterm elections.

bad news: that benedict arnold devin nunes won his re-election bid.

good news: nunes lost his house intel committee chair to adam schiff.

hard to believe that republicans re-elected chris collins and steve king. imagine having so much fear and hatred inside of you that you're willing to vote for morally bankrupt politicians like these guys just because they have rs by their names.

wendy davis got a fair amount of hype in her 2014 gubernatorial race against greg abbott. lost by 20%. four years later, beto o‚Äôrourke is going to lose a statewide race by just 3%. democrats are changing texas. fell short tonight, but we can take down senator john cornyn in 2020.

actually nancy pelosi said ‚Äúdrain the swamp‚Äù back in 2006. ronald reagan used the phrase too. if anybody stole it, it was trump. https://t.co/rgjiviw7kd

claire mccaskill and heidi heitkamp deserve huge props even in defeat. they both voted against brett kavanaugh knowing that in red states it could cost them their jobs. they did it because believing dr. ford was the right thing to do. better to lose a race than your soul.

@elizabethethorp @davidafrench the only answer. üëèüëèüëè

imagine if the 1.4 million former felons who are now legal voters after amendment 4 passed hadn't been suppressed by the gop this election. 

andrew gillum would've given a victory speech, not a concession one. the fight in florida isn't over. dems will beat trump there in 2020.

antonio delgado's win in a red district is a direct rebuke of trumpism. conservatives tried to swiftboat a brilliant candidate with racist smears and the voters of #ny19 saw through it. https://t.co/7jqbv6mpey

remember when dave brat tried to tell inmates he had it harder than them because political money was being spent against him? well, he can add losing to to his little sob story. democrat abigail spanbeger has flipped #va07!

barbara lee needs to have a house leadership position. give her joe crowley‚Äôs spot. her powerful voice deserves a larger role.

@valsantosonair kind of ranty but hope it helps!

@valsantosonair dems won back the house and are doing well in governor races. we‚Äôll get trump‚Äôs taxes, maybe impeachment in house. congressional maps for 2020s will be much fairer. senate map looks better in 2020. just a bad map. tonight could‚Äôve been better but could‚Äôve been much worse.

https://t.co/fo05qactpy

one person who will not sleep tonight is donald trump. house democrats are now liam neeson in taken and trump's tax returns are neeson's daughter.

democrats have officially won back house majority. the resistance did it! sorry, donald trump, but you can consider your legislative agenda dead.

ex-nfl player colin allred has knocked off 11-term republican congressman and house rules committee chair pete sessions in #tx32. this is such a gigantic win for both the democratic party and texas liberals. if you want to know who could be the next beto in tx, this is the guy.

beto o‚Äôrourke lost a close race tonight, but this is just the beginning. george h.w. bush lost two texas senate races and went on to become president. beto has also changed tx politics forever. when it eventually turns blue, we‚Äôll look back at this campaign as where it all began.

clarification: there is an openly bisexual governor, kate brown of oregon.

and laura kelly just upset trump stooge and voter suppression machine kris kobach in the kansas governor race. kansas went blue tonight!

there has never been a native american woman in congress. until now. sharice davids has busted through that glass ceiling, winning #ks03. effing awesome!

even ann coulter is jumping on the ted cruz dogpile. this is glorious. https://t.co/5ewucvxwhf

democrat jared polis has won in colorado, making history as america's first openly gay governor. this is such a huge step for our country!

marsha blackburn ran an ad about the refugee caravan that was straight up racist. hope that decision haunts her entire senate career.

and by closer to a dem majority i‚Äôm talking more about 2020 than tonight, because keeping the senate close is probably all we can hope for now.

do i like joe manchin? hell to the no. will never ever ever ever forget his kavanaugh vote. that said, he keeps democrats one step closer to a senate majority, so him winning is good news.

@samswey it's reason to celebrate and reason to be furious about past elections.

trying to ignore how depressing it is that amy mcgrath and joe donnelly lost and focus on how shockingly encouraging texas polls are for democrats.

@davidklion he was an incredibly obvious 2016 running mate, too. ugh.

sherrod brown winning so easily won't be a story, but it should be. republicans swore they had a great shot at winning this senate race after trump won ohio. they got smoked.

ugh. as if one pence in dc wasn't already bad enough, greg pence just won a house seat in indiana.

democrats have already flipped a house seat blue. jennifer wexton beats barbara comstock in virginia. comstock was awful. good riddance! #va10

@majorphilebrity nobody said such a thing. in fact, i regularly call black women the backbone of the democratic party because they are just that. i‚Äôm a big beyonc√© fan and appreciate all she does, but the timing was not awesome. maybe the campaign didn‚Äôt coordinate well. who knows?

america's stepdad tim kaine just kept confederate fanboy corey stewart from joining the senate, so i guess that's some pretty decent news.

@fiercerobert indeed in most cases. she‚Äôs from houston, and i think her endorsement would‚Äôve really helped there.

fox news just called missouri ag and senate candidate josh hawley ‚Äújeff hawley.‚Äù good to see that they brought their a game to election night. https://t.co/kgiobt6st0

@xo_bb_xo if she gets people there in the final two hours, i‚Äôll take it!

really appreciate beyonce endorsing beto o‚Äôrourke... but wouldn‚Äôt this have been much more powerful at this time yesterday? she usually nails her surprise announcements, too.

@amyvernon @kamalaharris absolutely. would like to see them both and many others run. have a contested primary and let the people decide which dem stands out.

trump made this election about him. he‚Äôs an egomaniac with no discipline. have a gut feeling that‚Äôs going to cost him dearly tonight.

@daveweigel ugh. hate exit polls, but this comparison is irresistible.

@samstein don‚Äôt blame them. many of us democrats didn‚Äôt sleep a wink and stayed up all night soul-searching. do not want to go back to that dark place.

@cruellaisdevine @pizzatothepolls thanks for sharing! i donated and y‚Äôall should too if you can afford to. even one pizza helps.

if you are standing in line to vote at the polls before they close at 6 or 7 pm, do not get out of line under any circumstance. regardless of your state, you have the legal right to vote. people might try to tell you to get out of line. do not budge an inch. #stayinline

@mattyglesias i will gladly stuff my face with crow should that happen.

hearing some voters in kansas (i went to college there) who always vote for republicans aren't voting for kris kobach. it's anecdotal, so take it with a grain of salt, but it also sounds like it's happening quite a bit.

tonight is the night we finally kick establishment republican pete sessions out of congress after 11 terms. colin allred is going to win this one if democrats close strong. let's do this, dallas. #tx32

i‚Äôm not just some ‚Äúcoastal liberal‚Äù either. i was born in kansas city and raised in springfield. my family lives there. i care about missouri and want to see it make the right choice today.

josh hawley allowed his ag office to be run by out-of-state consultants and the nra spent more on him than any other candidate. 

if missouri elects him to the us senate, they won‚Äôt be draining the swamp, they‚Äôll be filling it with radioactive slime. 

vote for claire mccaskill!

@shaunking @staceyabrams we have to want this election more, because there are two opponents: brian kemp and voter suppression.

@jordanuhl and what about non-english speakers? especially in florida after hurricane maria caused many puerto ricans to relocate, or in beto‚Äôs hometown of el paso.

@zacharybest how about believe and vote?! you need to have faith to take action, you have to take the action to make sure the faith was well-founded.

similar to not being able to fully detect trump‚Äôs momentum in 2016, polls are likely not capturing many young, new and inconsistent voters who will show up to vote blue. expecting +40 house gain for dems while they kill it in governor races and overperform in the senate. believe!

if you have conservative family call them today and say this: 

‚Äúright before you cast your vote, think about the parkland kids.‚Äù 

remind them that voting for republicans is a conscious choice not to address gun violence in america.

if beto o‚Äôrourke loses: he‚Äôll still be arguably the most popular young democrat alive who could run for president in 2020.

if ted cruz loses: his political career is over and he‚Äôll be remembered for inspiring bipartisan hatred and letting trump insult his wife‚Äôs looks.

the best things in life are free:

* taking a stroll through the park.
* curling up next to a crackling fire.
* watching the stars on a clear night.
* casting a vote against a republican.

the graceful, progressive campaigns of andrew gillum and stacey abrams have revealed a blueprint for defeating trumpism moving forward. even in red states, democrats don‚Äôt need to cling to the center, or run from diversity, or get down in the mud with republicans.

@jimcarrey @tedcruz here to watch conservatives get triggered and show fake outrage over something that‚Äôs actually a trump line... https://t.co/uwteqjv5au

@briankempga you are going down just like ed gillespie and his similarly trumpy campaign went down last year. the history books will remember you as a racist vote suppression machine, if they remember you at all.

election extra credit: whether it‚Äôs giving them rides, paying for uber or taxis, or just staying on their asses nonstop, make sure those busy/lazy/apathetic/overconfident liberals you know vote. we didn‚Äôt get enough of these people out in 2016.

election homework: less than a day left before polls start to close. reach out to independents and center-right voters you know. make a passionate plea for them to vote democrat this time. most reasonable people will consider it, perhaps just to slow down the rollercoaster.

ok. i'm done. i swear. this was a good distraction to avoid having a panic attack waiting for election day.

@sirdukedevin exactly right. they dismissed john mccain‚Äòs service because he wouldn‚Äôt join their cult.

infuriating to watch conservatives make a bigger deal out of ariana grande‚Äôs ex making a bad joke about a vet than the president of the united states continuing to incite domestic terrorism with inflammatory words after bombs have been sent to critics and a synagogue got shot up.

@aaronblake trump also didn‚Äôt inherit a recession.

republican gov. kim reynolds is holding her last campaign rally with rep. steve king, whose brand of white nationalism has become so radioactive that prominent conservatives are condemning him. what kind of a closing message does this send to iowa and the nation?

this is the argument to make with swing voters regarding gun violence: we have a generation of kids that have to go to school fearing they'll be shot. the nra exclusively gives to one party because only the gop is willing to look the other way.

@katrinahagen2 they have definitely had some financial problems compared to the past but i also think they try to manipulate their supporters with that stuff.

in indiana, missouri and tennessee, the nra is trying to buy itself some new senators. there's really no other way to explain it spending well over a million on republican candidates josh hawley, marsha blackburn and mike braun.

the nra has spent very little money supporting florida republicans this cycle and none on senate candidate rick scott. the parkland activists have totally stripped the gun lobby of their power in a state they have previously owned. significant.

what the nra spent supporting republicans and attacking democrats in competitive senate races...

mo: $1,363,000
tn: $1,252,000
in: $1,249,000
mt: $581,000
wv: $467,000
az: $211,000
wi: $146,000
tx: $79,000
nv: $69,000

a vote for the gop is a vote for the nra.

the president's campaign ad is so racist that even his white nationalist propaganda machine wants nothing to do with it. https://t.co/qux9tyr4hy

the republican party bans muslims, suppresses black voters, wants to end birthright citizenship, attacks women‚Äôs rights and is trying to erase trans people. the gop is waging a war on civil rights.

vote like the authoritarian president is a racist sexual predator who colluded with russia and won't show his taxes and violates the emoluments clause and incites nazi terrorism but the gop is complicit and the media is distracted so it's up to us to save the god damn country.

the election is about healthcare
the election is about healthcare
the election is about healthcare

the election is about healthcare

the election is about healthcare
the election is about healthcare

@nancytabak uhhh... it's a cardboard cutout of beto in the austin office. it's not photoshopped.

the troops enlisted in the armed services to protect their country, not to protect the republican majority in congress.

trump sending soldiers to the border as a political stunt shows that he is the one with no respect for the military.

@business @bopinion i‚Äôve actually seen in numerous places that it will be a $9b surplus. we sure the 6 number is up to date? good point regardless.

the way brian kemp and kris kobach have used their secretary of state, basically chief election officer, positions to try to suppress their way into governors mansions should be illegal. huge conflict of interest.

let‚Äôs put things in perspective:

less than 1,000 refugees fleeing hardships to legally seek asylum will make it to the us months from now.

more than 100 million people with pre-existing conditions will no longer be protected if the gop wins.

today we set our clocks back an hour for #daylightsavings.

tuesday conservatives will try to set america back decades by electing more republicans.

vote like your future depends on it.

this election cycle, the nra has spent $1.1 million attacking joe donnelly.

just last week, it spent $195,248 attacking phil bredesen and $170,951 attacking claire mccaskill.

democrats want to do something about the gun violence epidemic so the nra is spending big to stop them.

this sums up ted cruz, and his lack of a spine, quite well... https://t.co/dya07ktwby

obama era: republicans don‚Äôt care about pre-existing conditions and pretend to care about the deficit.

remember "fired up, ready to go?" most of the media isn't reporting this because they focus almost exclusively on trump's crazy shenanigans, but on a grassroots level, the left's energy feels a lot like 2008. https://t.co/qdypb28rwm

a poll released today has beto o'rourke tied with ted cruz. we have 3 days left to close out strong and shock the nation. honestly believe pollsters are underestimating both the blue wave and young voter surge in tx because both have never happened before. https://t.co/jryot0oins

harry truman said "the buck stops here" about the executive branch.

with donald trump it is now "the buck stops anywhere but here.‚Äù

elect democrats who will check the president, because he refuses to hold himself accountable and the gop lets him get away with whatever he wants.

iowa gov. kim reynolds budget priorities are out of whack. she keeps slashing education funding to pay for corporate giveaways and tax cuts for the 1%. iowa student loan debt has increased a whopping 28% during her time in office. https://t.co/07oukjqgpm

@sbvicby @theleft judging by past turnout numbers they are the people we need to keep engaged, though. also, a majority of non-voters have left-leaning ideologies but are apathetic. a big part of our mission is to keep people in the daily fight and recruit more to join us.

@liverpotlian yes. austin metro area extends into two other counties (hays and williamson), but most of it is in travis.

travis county, tx had 372,388 early voters. that's slightly more than 2016, a freakin' presidential election, and over 2.5 times the last midterm turnout. austin is bringing it for beto.

breaking news: michael cohen says donald trump is racist.

is basically the same thing as...

breaking news: michael cohen says water is wet.

trump: only republicans protect pre-existing conditions.

gop: what he said.

fact-checker: you tried to kill those protections 50+ times.

trump: look, a migrant invasion!

gop: what he said.

fact-checker: it‚Äòs a small group of mostly women &amp; kids that won‚Äôt be here for months.

gop closing argument: a caravan of 3,500 refugees 1,000 miles away from the us is our biggest crisis.

c‚Äômon, america. this election isn‚Äôt a hard decision.

@bantorture at this point what‚Äôs the difference?

ted cruz is now doing his best alex jones impersonation. he‚Äôs floating a wild conspiracy theory: beto o‚Äôrourke is paying for the refugee caravan with campaign funds. no facts to back it up either. this kind of bigoted, dishonest smear proves cruz is desperate. vote him out! https://t.co/b6ha3pzocb

@arthuratkinson0 it does in instances where they only need 51, but unfortunately, dems picking up one senate seat would be a minor miracle, so picking up two or three with this map might be impossible.

@allspinzone never know. he might pass out from a diet coke overdose and tweet exhaustion.

get out the vote. make this come true.

@nickriccardi the trump white house directly trafficked in unabashed racism to make democrats look weak or whatever and these morons didn't even bother to fact check and figure out that this happened on the gop's watch. as dumb as they are deplorable.

@starrizborn @4mericanpsych0 i do try to "be" best. the bots and trolls like to call me "worst," though. they are very creative.

@krislytle yup. straight ticket. although unfortunately i do not think he‚Äòs very likely to win.

@andrewfmoregon @velmajo03716611 and texas has two terrible ones!

just voted for beto o‚Äôrourke, justin nelson and kim olson. god damn it feels good to be a texas liberal casting votes for statewide democrats who might actually win.

@yashar @brianstelter hmm. personally, i don‚Äôt feel like it is conceding that the refugees are a threat, but instead pointing out that the smear is more asinine when you consider geography. also think it‚Äôs effective with swing voters. showed it to my conservative-ish dad and he kinda rethought things.

i don‚Äôt want oprah to run in 2020. we‚Äôve tried the whole celeb thing. i want her to spend about three months traveling the country campaigning for democrats. she‚Äôs a hell of a closer.

trump will regret sending 15k soldiers to the border, because it‚Äôs november and the war on christmas is here. there won‚Äôt be enough troops to fight in it. starbucks will use ‚Äúhappy holidays‚Äù cups and people won‚Äôt say ‚Äúmerry christmas‚Äù every few seconds. how will america survive?!

@mmpadellan also, following instructions during an eclipse!

gop iowa gov. kim reynolds is sticking with nazi-sympathizer steve king, a co-chair for her campaign. support her opponent, democrat @fredhubbell. polls show a tight race he can win. let republicans know that abetting white extremism will not be tolerated. https://t.co/u1wzemxypb

this is not hyperbole. outside of lisa murkowski, a handful of house members and a few governors, pretty much every single republican follows trump‚Äôs lead. the ben sasses talk a big game, but ultimately fall in line.

@jc5502 right. trump didn‚Äôt hijack the party. they created a monster they not only can‚Äôt control, but now the monster controls them.

donald trump‚Äôs willie horton-style ad once again proves that he‚Äôs a racist.

here‚Äôs the thing: if you‚Äôre in the gop, he owns your ass.  trump says ‚Äújump,‚Äù they say ‚Äúhow high?‚Äù they are scared to death of him. 

so any vote for any republican is a vote for trump and his racism.

after the gop tax scam, corporations spent 100 times more on stock buybacks than they did on worker bonuses and wage increases. trump can rage against ‚Äúelites‚Äù and pander to ‚Äúthe forgotten men and women,‚Äù but it‚Äôs clear republicans are helping the former and screwing the latter.

what‚Äôs next, republicans using old black-and-white footage of hubert humphrey to make a point? radio clips of fdr? it‚Äôs laughable. let‚Äôs talk about today.

we‚Äôre really talking about some shit harry reid said 25 years ago? that doesn‚Äôt matter. this election is about current democrat policies vs. current republican policies. trump and the gop don‚Äôt want to have that debate. they know their policies are terrible for most americans.

beating steve king would send a message to republicans that supporting white supremacy will cost you your job even in a ruby-red district. let‚Äôs work our asses off for @scholten4iowa and make that happen.

@jimcarrey republicans created this monster with decades of lies and prejudice and now they can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt stop him.

nfl players kneeling during the national anthem to peacefully protest social injustice isn't disrespecting the military. 

trump sending 5k soldiers to the border -- the number of us troops still in iraq -- to prop up a racist election strategy is disrespecting the military.

paul ryan wore his vertebrate costume today. after halloween he will ditch the backbone and revert back to his normal invertebrate form.

@medwoman1 a recent poll showed that 40% or so of texas voters won‚Äôt even vote for ag because they don‚Äôt know enough about the race.

texas attorney general ken paxton is not only an indicted crook, but tx ags sued the obama admin 48 times. electing democrat justin nelson would eliminate this practice when a democratic president hopefully takes over in 2021. doesn‚Äôt get lots of press, but this race is crucial.

bigotry is all the gop has right now. the stock market is struggling. wages are flat. domestic terrorism is booming. they oppose protecting pre-existing conditions. they won't do anything about climate change or gun violence. so they go all in on fearmongering and intolerance.

trump is potentially making a huge mistake pushing xenophobia as his closing argument. every republican in my family voted for trump or didn't vote because, ugh, they didn't like hillary. she's not on the ballot. he's overestimating how much of the us is nationalist based on '16.

white nationalist steve king has been anti-birthright citizenship for a long time so this could also make the hole he is currently digging himself in iowa even worse. j.d. scholten legitimately now has a shot to win that house race.

trump threatening to end the 14th amendment as a racist election strategy will ignite his white, rural base, but it could hurt dean heller (nv), martha mcsally (az), rick scott and ron desantis (fl), and ted cruz (tx) given those states' latinx populations. watch this backfire.

republicans treat the constitution and the bible the same way. cherry-pick what they like and claim it's untouchable, dismiss whatever doesn't fit their agenda.

@ohnoshetwitnt @mikel_jollett even if trump could count that high, he wouldn‚Äôt have the patience or discipline to make it all the way to 14.

where are the ‚Äúconservative constitutionalists‚Äù now that trump is threatening to get rid of the 14th amendment to end birthright citizenship? oh, i get it. they only like the constitution when it‚Äôs the second amendment or electoral college, not when it protects people of color.

@eclectablog jews for jesus makes about as much sense as lgbtq for pence.

seriously, if i were a refugee fleeing hardships i would not want to come to the us right now. that's very sad. we are a nation built by immigrants and to pretend we're anything but that is dishonest af.

single moms with cancer who might lose preexisting condition protections.

migrant toddlers in detention camps whose parents have been deported.

teenagers who will get shot in the next school shooting.

not even one of the most violent weeks in american history will stop donald trump, kellyanne conway, sarah sanders and the rest of this white house from lying. they‚Äôd rather keep pushing their false narrative than tell the truth and potentially save lives. it‚Äôs perverse.

"the president has denounced racism, hatred and bigotry in all forms.‚Äù - sarah sanders

no he hasn‚Äôt. 

donald trump wouldn‚Äôt even denounce david duke or the nazis who killed heather heyer. he consistently weasels his way out of condemning racism. https://t.co/lxbdhu1ppe

sarah sanders: "the president is not placing blame."

bullshit. placing blame is donald trump‚Äôs entire platform.

@aaronabarksdale thank you, aaron. appreciate it 

fox news has gotten so ugly that even drudge feels the need to put them on blast. https://t.co/1952jryt3k

@kellyscaletta thank you. i have nothing against religion in people‚Äòs personal lives, but what happened to separation of church and state? also, what is deeply offensive here is that she is using a massacre to make evangelical people feel like the actual victims.

here‚Äôs the video of kellyanne conway trying to blame the bloodshed on anti-religiosity and comedy. sick and tired of this white house always blaming the wrong people. (via @atrupar) https://t.co/psiu6mufaq

as a non-religious person who enjoys comedy kellyanne conway can kiss my ass. how about y‚Äôall blame anti-semites and white supremacists for domestic terrorism and not innocent people simply expressing their first amendment rights.

only donald trump would call the free press the ‚Äúenemy of the people,‚Äù then send a warm congratulatory message to brazil‚Äôs new far-right authoritarian president in the next tweet. it‚Äôs a pattern: show good people animosity and bad people acceptance.

kanye west is making "blexit" merch to encourage a black exit from the democratic party. what he actually seems to be encouraging is acceptance of the republican party's decades-long racist effort to silence black voices via mass incarceration, voter suppression &amp; gerrymandering.

one of donald trump‚Äôs supporters sent tom steyer a bomb a few days ago. he‚Äôs not dialing down the attacks, he‚Äôs cranking them up. it‚Äôs despicable. https://t.co/4fit0trv92

@townoh thank you for your dedication and i hope better health days are ahead.

if you think you are too busy to volunteer for campaigns, will ferrell canvassed for stacey abrams this weekend. some people have second jobs or bad health and can‚Äôt, but the rest of us have no excuse. https://t.co/uk3yncejhy

at trump rallies, crowds often chant "lock her up" about hillary clinton and her unsecured emails while waiting for donald trump to speak. the irony here is during some of those moments trump is likely talking on an unsecured cell phone while china and russia listen in.

@its_whitney just when you think you can‚Äôt possibly like lebron anymore...

the magabomber. the kentucky murders. the pittsburgh mass shooting.

this week has shown us why we need to elect people like andrew gillum, beto o'rourke &amp; stacey abrams not like ron desantis, ted cruz &amp; brian kemp.

we need uniters not dividers, leaders who spread hope not fear.

scary that even after a week like this trump supporters still don‚Äôt want to tone down the hate. https://t.co/r0mhctmrbe

@angryblacklady you're right. lots of work to do. advocacy is a daily fight, especially for us who are insulated from the hate, but voting can be a part of the solution. if we had a democratic president and congress right now we might have an assault weapon ban and universal background checks.

@rickyd224 it wasn't *social justice warriors* but the indian community. they didn't previously interject because the group's lack of representation in entertainment meant they had no voice. the issue of always being portrayed as cab drivers or convenience store owners was a solid point.

the group we should be scared about isn't central american asylum seekers, it's crazed far-right militia members who are planning to head to the border with arms to stop innocent refugees. once again, trump rhetoric is inciting potential violence. https://t.co/iv4hevzdux

@thelovebel0w this is spot on. lump them into the basket of deplorables and they go nuts, but trump voters are the first ones to lump others into unfair baskets.

@pittsburghslim as i white dude i am not afraid to recognize that i benefit more than almost anybody else. that doesn't mean i don't have talent or worth, it just means society favors me. admitting that is the least we can do.

in our society, it's not uncommon for white men to get more credit than others for the work they do. 

american terrorism is the exact opposite. white men do the majority of the work and get no credit.

@rickyd224 apu is an outdated racist stereotype. hank azaria, who voices the character, even said we should listen to indian people on that one. as far as halloween goes, i could give a fuck what people wear as long as again it isn't racist. just this week megyn kelly said blackface was ok.

@saintjoe9999 nailed it. they operate out of fear and scarcity. if someone else gets something, they lose something. if another religion or movement has merit, it invalidates their beliefs. the world doesn‚Äôt work like that.

liberals don‚Äôt want people to say bigoted stuff or incite violence. other than that say whatever the hell you want and let the comedy rip. conservatives who clutch their pearls over the f word or a joke about eye makeup are actually much more ‚Äòpc.‚Äô

this grotesque pittsburgh mass shooting is a hate crime. not only have republicans failed to do anything about the gun violence epidemic, they‚Äôve failed to do anything about the spike in hate crimes since trump‚Äôs election. since the gop won‚Äôt take action, we will with our votes.

@laureennarro @katiehill4ca thank you and everyone else making sacrifices to help win this election! katie is fantastic. got to know her campaign through the vice series.

@margotbeezley another group that would want to keep their voting preference somewhat secret. thanks for your dedication!

anyway, take nothing for granted. progressives, liberals and left-leaning independents have to outwork the right over the last 10 or so days before the election. that's how we'll win. let's close this out strong.

these things give me hope: new voters, young voters &amp; people of color often aren't polled well. some suburban white women married to trump voters will likely vote democrat, not tell polls or their husbands. trump fatigue will encourage late-breakers to vote for opposition party.

most election projections and betting markets gave trump less than a 20% chance of winning at this point in 2016. democrats have about the same chance to win the senate. don't get discouraged or listen to polls. keep fighting. very possible the blue wave is being undercalculated.

now that the #magabomber has been arrested, let‚Äôs get back to the election.

what democratic house candidates are you focused on helping right now and why do you support them?

let me know. i‚Äôll retweet some of the replies to help get the message out.

texas voting machines are switching votes when people vote straight party. double check your ballot. ugh. from voter id to voter suppression to gerrymandering to outdated machines, the state‚Äôs election process is the worst. by gop design.https://t.co/nzpglv3x1p

remember that time bernie sanders said that the second amendment people can do something about hillary clinton? of course you don‚Äôt because that was donald trump, the only politician who encouraged supporters to use weapons against opponents. https://t.co/qo2bxekk47

@socflyny as long as it doesn‚Äôt distract too much from the issues, i think some democrats should definitely say donald trump has divided the country and his rhetoric and behavior have proven to be dangerous, so elect me to put a check on him before this gets more out of control.

terrorism - noun
ter¬∑ror¬∑ism

: the systematic use of terror especially as a means of coercion

conservatives, it might shock you but there‚Äôs nothing about having to be done by a muslim in there. far-right and/or white supremacist acts of terror are terrorism. period.

@jeffreytoobin @usps the usps is also an example of socialism working well. its not perfect, but if our entire government worked as well as the usps does, we‚Äôd be in a much better place.

switched over to fox news and within the first three seconds someone already said ‚Äúlone wolf‚Äù about the #magabomber. can you sprain your eyes from rolling them too hard?

@shaunking @andrewgillum right-wingers are scared to death of andrew gillum because they know he has a powerful voice that is going to change florida and possibly all of america one day.

"be careful what you wish for max!"

can't stop thinking about these seven words trump tweeted to maxine waters. makes me sick to my stomach.

right-wing america will spin this as an isolated incident but it is definitely not so don‚Äôt let them get away with it.

cesar sayoc, aka the #magabomber, isn‚Äôt an anomaly. there‚Äôs a pattern of violence committed by men radicalized by trump rhetoric. the maga movement has been told america belongs to them and those who disagree are enemies of the state. this message inspires homegrown terrorism.

cesar sayoc was driving around in a silence of the lambs van that had crosshairs over barack obama, hillary clinton, jill stein, michael moore, van jones, etc. and nobody thought that was suspicious??? https://t.co/igtspawqjg

@ohnoshetwitnt tobin and squi can back that up.

10:19 am: donald trump implies the ‚Äúbomb stuff‚Äù is a liberal hoax.

less than an hour later: the shockingly predictable magabomber is a middle-aged man who gets arrested in plantation, florida of all places driving a creepy van plastered with right-wing stickers.

incredible.

trump: why is the media focused on this bomb stuff?

aide: the fbi keeps finding explosive devices, sir.

trump: fake news! they should talk about my middle-class tax cut.

aide: mr. president, you literally made that up.

trump: you‚Äôre fired. get me a diet coke on the way out.

@realdonaldtrump the mind of donald j. trump is so fucked up that as many of his critics face assassination attempts he still finds a way to make himself the victim.

@realdonaldtrump see a doctor. you are clearly not well.

this is a god damn disgrace. the president of the united states is now whining about how it is inconvenient for republicans that their political opponents are being sent bombs while hinting at a conspiracy theory. https://t.co/ojfra8midr

add cory booker and james clapper to the list of trump critics who have now been sent bombs. the way we fight back is to vote for democrats who will be a check on the president‚Äôs behavior and change the temperature of our political climate.

if the gop was serious about protecting pre-existing conditions then the 20 red states that are suing to end obamacare (and its pre-existing condition protections) would end their lawsuit. spoiler alert: they won't.

@danawantsbeer she wrote an op-ed today. https://t.co/avlxoxl8de

c‚Äômon, caitlyn jenner, you did not think donald trump would help trans people. he picked mike pence as his veep, for chrissakes. you thought he would help your bank account.

@symonedsanders today was the day michael avenatti never became president.

@shaunking @michaelavenatti exactly. obama got six million votes more than any white man who has ever been a presidential nominee. 10 years ago! hillary clinton got three million more. in this moment, based on numbers, the better argument is that it will likely take someone who is not a white male.

@mollyjongfast it's from the movie only lovers left alive. unfortunately, the timeline we are living in is on its way to being only trumpers left alive.

campaign finance reform
free college tuition
$15 minimum wage
scotus liberal majority
environment is saved

this path starts with electing democrats on 11/6.

@turtlesgaloremr liberals aren‚Äôt nearly as susceptible to this sort of thing. will not happen to the left. on november 7 we will start working to prevent that.

there isn‚Äôt a word in the english language strong enough to capture how negatively i view donald trump. but i would never wish physical harm upon him. today isn‚Äôt who we should be as americans. let‚Äôs vote for democrats, get back to focusing on ideas not insults, stop the madness.

right-wingers: ‚Äúeric holder making a metaphor is a sign that the apocalypse is upon us. panic!‚Äù

also right-wingers: ‚Äúa unabomber wannabe sending bombs to prominent liberals is a false flag. relax!‚Äù

democrats should counter the gop hashtag #jobsnotmobs with something like #equalitynotexplosives given the right-wing racism and attempted assassinations.

bombs being mailed to the clintons, the obamas and cnn right now.

innocent refugees seeking asylum who will be here months from now. 

one of these things is an imminent threat, the other isn‚Äôt a threat at all.

@katseyes45 exactly. heather heyer died and the president blamed the victims as much as the perpetrators. but it was him who incited the violence.

in the past few days people have tried to bomb:

the clintons
the obamas
george soros

and nancy pelosi was recently confronted by a mob.

this is no coincidence as these are the four biggest targets of dangerous right-wing rhetoric. conservatives are going to get someone killed.

#gagovdebate report card:

stacey abrams: a-

could've hit opponents harder, but she stayed positive. focused on her accomplishments and policies.

brian kemp: c

was irritable and went super negative. couldn't defend his record.

ted metz: d-

showed up, had a pulse.

stacey abrams said a lot of smart things about criminal justice reform, but this stood out the most: "we need to decriminalize being poor in georgia." #gagovdebate

lol. brian kemp literally just said to "blame obama" for kemp's own voter suppression. when all else fails, you can always count on republicans blaming obama and/or hillary. #gagovdebate

"this is someone who had a woman arrested for helping her blind father vote." -stacey abrams on brian kemp's pattern of voter suppression. #gagovdebate

stacey abrams' parents were hit by hurricane katrina, health problems and cancer, and abrams went into debt to provide for them (along with student debt), which is honorable. brian kemp continuing to hammer abrams for taking care of her family is a low blow. #gagovdebate

@americansoaring watch here: https://t.co/gfahb3rrqz

@dfbscb in some ways better (weed), in some ways worse (they hate government even more).

republican brian kemp and libertarian ted metz are ganging up on stacey abrams, consistently trying to smear her, in the #gagovdebate and she is still clearly outperforming both. she really was made for this.

@cmclymer that‚Äôs not a metaphor for the alarming voter suppression going on in ga. not at all.

gop gubernatorial candidate brian kemp just said in the #gagov debate that he won't recuse himself as secretary of state if the governor's race goes to a recount. really scary when you consider his history of voter suppression.

things adults shouldn‚Äôt believe in:

* the tooth fairy
* the easter bunny
* imaginary friends
* republicans who say they'll protect pre-existing conditions

today's conservative midterm message: vote gop and you won't get killed by an imaginary ms-13/isis/zombie invasion, but you will be able to proudly call yourself a nationalist. subtle!

‚Äúfox news. there‚Äôs no proof of anything.‚Äù

colin allred is a terrific democratic candidate that we haven‚Äôt heard enough about. here he is in the #tx32 debate hitting republican pete sessions for being a swamp monster who‚Äôs one of the biggest recipients of corporate pac money in congress. https://t.co/dg2o8yzhf0

you can let racist gop fearmongering convince you to vote against your own self-interests or vote democrat to...

* save pre-existing condition protections
* stop deficit-exploding tax cuts for 1%
* protect medicare and social security

shouldn't be a hard choice for most voters.

@daveweigel if there‚Äôs one thing i can‚Äôt resist it‚Äôs retweeting a total recall reference.

what donald trump means when he calls himself a ‚Äúnationalist‚Äù is white nationalist, because a president who hurts the us to benefit the saudis and russians for selfish reasons isn‚Äôt someone who puts our nation first.

the right‚Äôs antisemitic attacks on george soros provoked some nutjob to put a bomb in his mailbox. the republican slogan ‚Äújobs not mobs‚Äù rings hollow after this.

@realdonaldtrump lookie here. a trump endorsement without fearmongering about the us becoming venezuela.

remember how you felt the morning after election day 2016? remember how hellish the past two years have been, especially for marginalized americans?

unless liberals want to feel this way november 7 and two years afterward, we have to outwork conservatives to get out the vote.

texas gov. greg abbott jokes that because tx has a bigger economy than russia, he's more powerful than putin.

a. unless you also have nuclear weapons and dirt on trump, no you're not.

b. with russia interfering in our election again, this isn't a laughing matter.

#houstonrally

@seanalyn ha! even if someone thinks ted cruz is attractive on the outside, which is subjective i suppose, he‚Äôs ugly on the inside for sure.

beautiful ted? people are right about donald trump‚Äòs vocabulary shrinking because ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù is one of the last words in the english language that should be used to describe ted cruz.

@katebennett_dc @realdonaldtrump beautiful ted? gross. even his own wife probably wouldn‚Äôt call him that. he looks the lovechild of grandpa munster and alf, and the man has no soul.

the president of the united states is coming to campaign for him and ted cruz can still only fill the toyota center, which has a capacity of 19k. beto o‚Äôrourke recently held a rally with 55k people attending. can you say enthusiasm gap?

@ericagrieder @cltomlinson the problem with that. most of the gop is doing a job interview like trump is hiring them ‚Äî not voters.

@vbarnett323 and for young voters, the ones who often don‚Äôt show, it is a huge issue. not disagreeing those other priorities are larger, but we can walk and chew gum at the same time.

@vbarnett323 it‚Äôs a healthcare issue, imo. can assist with pain and emotional well-being while helping get people off of opioids.

75% of democrats, 71% of independents and even 53% of republicans want marijuana legalized. don‚Äôt understand why democrats don‚Äôt pound this issue waaaaaaaay more. in much of the country there is only upside. https://t.co/3qxmdjkto0

don‚Äôt have a problem with van jones interviewing jared kushner.

do have a problem with jones asking kushner fox-style softball questions.

@tigerli57435526 this is true. imagine cutting 20% of school days to kick back more to corporations. absurd.

democrats aren‚Äôt going to turn the us into venezuela. 

republicans are going to turn the us into kansas and oklahoma. 

red states where reckless tax cuts for the 1% caused massive budget shortfalls, resulting in schools, pensions, infrastructure, etc. being underfunded.

@michelleobama @whenweallvote thank you for your leadership, flotus! you heard her, get out the vote, y‚Äôall.

why can‚Äôt trump praise a republican without saying a democrat will turn the us into venezuela? because republicans haven‚Äôt accomplished anything except the unpopular gop tax scam, so he resorts to scare tactics. https://t.co/ph54uoscf1

@ngeiling absolutely. ‚Äúan economy that lasts.‚Äù

andrew gillum had an outstanding debate, but his brightest moment was this eloquent closing statement about rejecting donald trump‚Äôs quest to divide america. #flgovdebate https://t.co/dd3vndz8rs

just once, just once, i want to watch a debate where a republican doesn‚Äôt invoke the name of george soros as an antisemitic dog whistle. #flgovdebate

‚Äúi‚Äôm not gonna be involved in the washington food fight anymore. i‚Äôve been there, done that, got the t-shirt.‚Äù ron desantis might be the corniest person on the planet. #flgovdebate

ron desantis blamed ‚Äúschool security‚Äù for school shootings.

andrew gillum fired back that he is ‚Äúwholly owned by the nra.‚Äù

desantis is the typical florida republican who will continue to do absolutely nothing as innocent kids keep getting murdered. #flgovdebate

‚Äúmr. desantis himself used to moderate a xenophobic, racist facebook page.‚Äù andrew gillum did not did not come to play. he refused to let ron desantis explain away his record of racism. #flgovdebate

* - not to be confused with the trump family tax scam.

andrew gillum called the gop tax bill ‚Äúthe trump tax scam‚Äù and i‚Äôm here for it. exactly what it was. #flgovdebate

ron desantis told a cancer patient who wanted to know how they‚Äôd have access to health care without insurance coverage ‚Äúyou can always go to the emergency room.‚Äù wow. andrew gillum slammed him for picking insurance companies over people with pre-existing conditions. #flgovdebate

andrew gillum roasts the florida gop‚Äôs climate change denial: ‚Äúwhat florida voters need to know is that when they elect me governor they‚Äôre gonna have a governor who believes in science, which we haven‚Äôt had for quite some time in this state.‚Äù #flgovdebate https://t.co/ixehsos1uw

the trump-pence white house and its gop accomplices want to erase transgender americans. protect our trans friends by voting as many republicans out on nov. 6 as possible. #transrightsarehumanrights

lindsey graham admitted ‚Äúfinancial contributions will stop‚Äù if republicans don‚Äôt keep cutting taxes for big donors. it‚Äôs why the gop would rather let you die from a pre-existing condition than tell the kochs, richard uihlein or sheldon adelson that billionaire welfare is a no-go.

"anybody who votes for a democrat now is crazy." - trump

ah, yes, it‚Äôs way less crazy to vote for the gop, a party of nazis, pedophiles, torturers and a sexual predator, tax cheat, russian puppet potus who want to cut medicare and social security to pay for billionaire tax cuts.

here's a recent source to back up this claim about budget deficits, for all the fox news watchers who don't want to believe it: https://t.co/yu05jlgtwd https://t.co/9i674nhy7h

reagan/bush 41 grew the deficit.

clinton left a surplus.

bush 43 grew the deficit.

obama brought it down.

trump is growing the deficit.

a democrat will clean up the mess.

there's a pattern. hint: it's not republicans are fiscal conservatives, democrats spend irresponsibly.

@jonfromcali it is hysterical, but it is also true as she has two million followers. a huge swath of the right looks to her for punditry and policy ideas.

omg, eric holder instructed people to kick conservatives metaphorically, i'm like soooooooo offended... now let me make a joke out of a murdered us journalist to show people how much i want hillary to die. civility!

we hear lots about a so-called trump derangement syndrome on the left, but here is a thought-leader on the right making a "joke" about hillary clinton being tortured to death and dismembered with a bone saw two years after hrc left politics. this is clinton derangement syndrome. https://t.co/fzenx61pip

pre-existing conditions
pre-existing conditions
pre-existing conditions

democrats cannot say this enough during the last few weeks before the midterms. with the gop suing to end the aca, this election is literally life or death for many voters. they need to be reminded of that.

using venezuela to represent all socialism is like using nickelback to represent all rock music.

@realdonaldtrump how many mass shootings have happened on rick scott‚Äôs watch? what about florida‚Äôs disgusting stand your ground law? scott has blood on his hands.

@realdonaldtrump rick scott banned the term ‚Äúclimate change‚Äù and has ignored the environmental crisis we‚Äôre in. floridians will continue to pay the price.

@realdonaldtrump rick scott suppresses voting rights by denying ex-felons who‚Äôve earned that right.

@realdonaldtrump rick scott oversaw the largest medicare fraud in american history.

@realdonaldtrump rick scott is voldemort in a suit.

#ifiwonabilliondollars the world would know i was a billionaire but not trump because he won‚Äôt show his taxes.

@mirandayaver whatever happens, he has a bright future and has changed both the the texas political landscape and the blueprint for democratic campaigns.

@metsmerized i‚Äôm no longer at fansided, or even in sports, but great company! amazing group of people.

we literally had to lock up our phones in pouches so nobody would tweet or whatever during the filming. someone needs to get one of those to the white house asap.

went to the #podsaveamericahbo taping in austin tonight. really well done show. beto was on fire. every answer super smooth, like a tiny ted talk. not to be confused with a ted cruz talk. those are always cringeworthy.

@shannonrwatts @betoorourke @momsdemand i was there. her interview segment almost made me tear up. she‚Äôs amazing.

@mattyglesias or two days of marijuana being legal? hard to say.

one thing i‚Äôve noticed during all these senate debates is that republicans do fine when they fearmonger and smear, but ask them to defend trump and the past two years and they unravel.

a reporter telling a troll ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù doesn‚Äôt matter. 

the ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù that matters is the one republicans are planning to give you by taking your healthcare, medicare and social security.

stay focused on the elections and vote for democrats.

beto o‚Äôrourke just raised more money in a quarter than any senate candidate in history and also held one of the biggest political rallies ever. hardly a freakin‚Äô lightweight. https://t.co/uvc32rkakz

scott walker saying he'll make sure you have coverage for pre-existing conditions as he sues to get rid of them is like someone robbing your house while pretending to sell you homeowners coverage. https://t.co/3nqiviyglb

republicans don‚Äôt care about ethics, norms or hypocrisy. only about winning. democrats should always approach things with that in mind.

the conservative civility police who clutched their pearls over eric holder making a metaphor won‚Äôt have a damn thing to say about donald trump praising greg gianforte for assaulting a journalist. watch.

dem senator heidi heitkamp hits the gop hard on medicare and social security, sayings they've always planned to cut both. she also says republicans insult seniors by calling these programs they've paid for 'entitlements.' 100% correct. #ndsendebate https://t.co/uqaxvllpdr

@katscheve i grew up in missouri. born in kc, raised in springfield, went to mizzou. not saying people shouldn‚Äôt have guns. but missouri‚Äôs gun laws are a joke. stand your ground for example. we have a gun violence epidemic in this country and action must be taken.

claire mccaskill talks gun reform. gotta appreciate a red-state democrat who‚Äôs willing to fight so hard to stop gun violence she gets an f grade from the nra. that‚Äôs putting people before politics. #mosenatedebate https://t.co/oqvcgn39ee

beto also points out that his son, ulysses francis o‚Äôrourke, has the initials ufo, which is dope.

@mirandayaver knock on wood and get out the vote!

ted cruz and other conservatives have smeared beto o‚Äôrourke for his nickname ‚Äî what a stupid effing thing to focus on ‚Äî and he explains that anyone who‚Äôs born and raised in el paso with the name ‚Äúrobert‚Äù gets called ‚Äúbeto‚Äù instead. #texastownhall https://t.co/xcgha0552b

no clue what john bolton and john kelly yelled at each other about today. but i do know what they'll be yelling about three weeks from now. the trump admin becoming a lame-duck presidency because democrats took control of congress.

@realdonaldtrump almost every republican has been trying to get rid of pre-existing protections since the aca started, so trump will have to talk to literally the entire party.

don‚Äôt believe their lies.

if they win, the gop is coming for your healthcare, your social security and your medicare.

in two years time, jason chaffetz went from claiming he couldn‚Äôt look his daughter in the eye if he supported trump to acting exactly like trump. this transformation is a microcosm of the republican party.

republicans have literally spent the past decade trying to stop democrats from ensuring that americans with pre-existing conditions can get healthcare. now almost every gop candidate is claiming they are for pre-existing protections. maybe the biggest party-line lie of all time.

americans now have two reasons to be jealous of canada: single-payer healthcare and legalized marijuana.

ted cruz reminded us why he‚Äôs accomplished little and is disliked by even his own party. he‚Äôs a smug, dishonest hack with outdated ideas.

beto o‚Äôrourke is an authentic, inspiring disruptor who wants to make government work for everybody, not just those at the top.

#texasdebate

ted cruz can praise #metoo and try to frame himself as an advocate, but actions speak louder than words and he‚Äôs supported brett kavanaugh, donald trump and roy moore. #texasdebate

‚Äúwhy does he not vote for universal background checks in a country that loses 30,000 people to gun violence every year? follow the money.‚Äù - beto o‚Äôrourke points out the $ ted cruz has received from @nra as mass shootings keep hitting tx.
#texasdebate

‚Äúreally interesting to hear you talk about a partisan circus after your last six years in the senate.‚Äù 

beto o‚Äôrourke gets another good dig in, reminding voters of all the drama ted cruz always brings.

(via @texastribune)
https://t.co/dhg9k3jzmr

beto o‚Äôrourke mentions that under republican leadership tx is the least insured state in the us, which is disgraceful given the size of the state‚Äôs economy. when asked how we pay for universal healthcare, he gives the correct answer: by reversing the gop tax scam. #texasdebate

‚Äúhe‚Äôs dishonest. it‚Äôs why the president called him lyin‚Äô ted, and it‚Äôs why the nickname stuck. because it‚Äôs true.‚Äù - beto o‚Äôrourke absolutely destroyed ted cruz here. wow. #texasdebate https://t.co/wfoxmzx7op

beto o‚Äôrourke comes out swinging. immediately hits ted cruz for spending $5 million on cambridge analytica, the super shady data company that played a negative role in the 2016 election. #texasdebate

beto o‚Äôrourke introduces himself in english and spanish, reminding voters that he is bilingual. ted cruz is not. #texasdebate

@shandat612 throw in hillary clinton and nancy pelosi and you would die from alcohol poisoning.

at tonight‚Äôs debate, ted cruz will once again try to paint beto o‚Äôrourke as a radical. you know what‚Äôs actually radical? trying to take away people‚Äôs healthcare, supporting trump‚Äôs family separation policy, &amp; exploding the deficit with tax breaks for billionaires. #txsenatedebate

@mollyjongfast @jbouie the g on scott walker's letter jacket isn't for green bay, it's for gerrymandering.

@speechboy71 conservatives, and particularly evangelicals, don't care if he's a colossal tax cheat as long as he continues to be a bully who's pushing their agenda.

the only reason we are talking about dennis hof's death is because the republican party allowed an actual pimp to become a general election candidate.

@dcjohnnorton it's like, how do you fight a political group that gets outraged by absolutely everything their opponent does, but never takes accountability for anything they do?

hillary clinton and john kerry couldn‚Äôt even sneeze without getting criticized by conservatives, but current secretary of state mike pompeo giggles with the crown prince after the saudis chopped up a us resident/journalist and all you hear from the right is crickets.

@babaohreally that's upsetting. it was my understanding that he was never a significant donor for either party, but if that's incorrect, i would love to know. still, he's been a very committed owner who has served fans well, and as a philanthropist, few people have done what he was able to do.

and, yes, this spot is silly af but that's on purpose. ted cruz has focused on frivolous stuff for his entire career and deserves to be mocked for it.

this new anti-ted cruz ad hits him for calling beto o'rourke a "triple meat whataburger liberal" -- uh, whatever the hell that is -- and his love of white castle. there are no white castles in texas, but as the ad points out there might be in canada, ted's birthplace. https://t.co/96tbfxglnp

ugh. hate to bring up the 2000 election, but on the other hand that memory should motivate liberals. makes my blood boil.

this is one of the more important state courts in the country. after the 2000 election it ruled to have a state recount so every legally cast vote would count, until a controversial scotus decision ruled against it.

the florida supreme court has stopped rick scott‚Äôs shady attempt to pack the bench with three new justices during the final hours of his term. the next governor will now appoint those judges, making it even more crucial that andrew gillum wins.

now that elizabeth warren has proved her native american ancestery, it‚Äôs time for donald trump to do 3 things:

1. stop using the racist slur ‚Äúpocahontas.‚Äù

2. keep his promise and give a million dollars to charity.

3. she took the dna test. now he needs to show us his taxes.

@mmjblair it's like harry truman said about the gop, which amazingly still works perfectly, "how many times do you have to get hit over the head until you figure out who‚Äôs hitting you?‚Äù

@mmjblair they think that money/success is their white birthright that is being kept from them by the "others" and if they support people like trump they will one day get there. the joe the plumber delusional types. and if they don't, well, at least "someone like me" is still on top.

right-wing america perpetuates the myth that the ‚Äútakers‚Äù are blue states, liberals, immigrants and people of color. in reality, the takers are wealthy people like kushner and trump who don‚Äôt pay taxes, and red states that take way more from the treasury than they put back in.

@fiondavision @canadianglen which is what makes the group‚Äôs identity and nationalism even more confusing.

donald trump apologized to brett kavanaugh, called dr. ford‚Äôs allegations a hoax, mocked the rules of #metoo and invited serial woman beater jim brown to the white house. 

that‚Äôs just this week.

also, ‚Äúthis is what happens in a country that doesn‚Äôt make mental health a priority,‚Äù because in addition to not being well read both kanye and trump are clearly unwell.

@20sidedgeis that strategy has really fueled the campaigns of andrew gillum, beto o‚Äôrourke, stacey abrams and countless other democrats who seem to be overperforming in red states. tough yet classy. you definitely present a good question that i go back and forth on myself, though.

@ikebarinholtz not to mention trump spending almost an hour ranting on fox news.

@20sidedgeis we can have different kinds of leaders. not all need to be bare-knuckle brawlers. some can be happy warriors? also, i‚Äôm of the mind that our brightest leaders should let pundits get their hands in the muck and keep themselves pristine. present a clear alternative to trumpism.

while the current first lady whines about being bullied, michelle obama, the most unfairly treated flotus in history, continues to preach tolerance for the same people who showed her none. her grace is unparalleled.

donald trump is doing another pointless rally -- one of his ego therapy sessions -- in erie, pennsylvania while a hurricane is still happening in florida and georgia. he only cares about himself. fl and ga voters should remember that on election day.

fact check: trump's campaign manager, deputy campaign manager, personal lawyer and national security adviser have all pled guilty.

it's been two days since taylor swift's ig post. about 250k voters have registered in that period, a ridiculously huge spike compared to average numbers. trump won due to 77k voters in three states (mi, pa and wi) and other 2016 races were close. swift could swing some elections.

@jbmcneil15 nice call. was terrible what happened to steve scalise, 100%, but some people who had nothing to say about giffords suddenly got real concerned.

@kathygriffin a similar group tried to run me off the internet a year ago after i spoke up about toxic masculinity. weaponized a handful of my decade old tweets i had clearly moved past &amp; claimed responsibility for. threatened me, harassed my mom, gf. anything to uphold status quo/patriarchy.

ted cruz canceled the second debate and is now chickening out of a town hall with beto o‚Äôrourke. his problem can‚Äôt be cnn, he recently debated bernie sanders on the channel. more proof cruz is not ‚Äútough as texas.‚Äù https://t.co/muvgvadhoy

pete sessions is chairman of the house rules committee. this has allowed him to be the biggest roadblock to pot legislation in congress. he's waged war on medical marijuana -- hurting people who are in pain -- plus weed in general. gotta defeat this guy. https://t.co/iwodojqe5e

mike pence is in texas campaigning for pete sessions and ted cruz. the gop is terrified both will lose so they are pulling out all the stops. if tx democrats can beat cruz and sessions, two of the worst republicans alive, it will be the most successful election cycle in decades.

@wagner_rob @rozsajh there's no reason for us not to have election day be a federal holiday other than the gop wanting to depress voter turnout.

in many us cities we celebrate indigenous peoples day instead of columbus day, because we‚Äôre not history-illiterate jerks like the doofus sitting in the oval office.

60 minutes interviewing susan collins is pointless. there‚Äôs no defending her kavanaugh vote. once again her actions are odds with her words and how she presents herself. that‚Äôs now her legacy.

liberals have substantive reasons to hate the gop: bad wars, corruption, discrimination and terrible policies.

brett kavanaugh will be the first justice who was nominated by a president who lost the popular vote, confirmed by senators who represent a population minority, and opposed in polls by a majority of americans.

trump says our political system is rigged. it is rigged. for the gop.

@gerryconway it's only been nuked on judicial nominees so far.

george soros hasn't given a dime to most liberals, but he gave trump $160 million for the trump international hotel &amp; tower in chicago in 2004. so who's really "paid by soros?" https://t.co/y5q3fqwzhw

p.s. - this isn‚Äôt about my thoughts on al franken (i thought he needed to resign), but about the hypocrisy of how the gop treated his allegations so differently than even more serious ones regarding trump, kavanaugh,  moore, etc.

@zoeyorkwrites i personally thought franken needed to resign. that‚Äôs not the point. the point is conservatives treated him totally different than what they are saying they want now.

conservatives didn't care about due process for hillary clinton.

conservatives didn't care about the burden of proof for birtherism.

conservatives didn't care about equal protection for gay customers.

conservatives didn't care about the presumption of innocence for al franken.

a crazed conservative asked for help "killing liberals in their sleep!" this is what trump, the gop, the nra and right-wing propaganda have done to our country. https://t.co/ave426wr5p

as a republican on the senate judiciary committee, ted cruz is one of the people most responsible for brett kavanaugh's confirmation. in a month we can make him pay by electing beto o'rourke. losing a us senate seat in texas is the gut punch the gop deserves.

@tweet_dec @jwomack @danpfeiffer if we are arguing things states should do let‚Äôs win enough governors mansions to get to over 270 for the national popular vote and scrap the electoral college.

tldr - this is how ruthless the democratic senate majority leader in 2021 needs to be... https://t.co/yar6crumhm

when democrats take back power they need to do what mcconnell would do if he were a dem. nuke the filibuster. statehood for dc and pr. add two scotus seats to make up for trump‚Äôs illegitimate ones. investigate and impeach justice kavanaugh. no more bringing knives to a gunfight.

@mik3ferguson he got 48/49. mcconnell had as many defections as he did. not sure i blame schumer. maybe i‚Äôm in the minority, though?

nobody on the left should make excuses for joe manchin‚Äôs cowardice. other red-state democrats who are much more vulnerable ‚Äî donnelly, heitkamp and mccaskill ‚Äî took a much bigger risk than the one he refused to take.

@tonyposnanski they truly boofed our country.

i took a nap, did all of my laundry, slow-roasted prime rib, watched the godfather trilogy, even had time to go to the dmv... and she was still talking.

what was the point of that longwinded susan collins rant, to break the guinness world record for most excuses in a single speech?

congrats, susan collins, with your yes vote you just lost your re-election bid! 

you can count on angry liberals camping out in maine, flooding money to your opponent, doing whatever we can to flip red to blue. 

looking forward to the lobster and ending your political career.

is this susan collins, or is mitch mcconnell just a really good ventriloquist? this doesn‚Äôt sound like the independent senator we‚Äôve heard so much about, it sounds like a bunch of gop talking points.

what susan collins doesn‚Äôt get is that the nominee‚Äôs identity never even mattered because he was nominated by an unindicted co-conspirator in federal crimes who is also currently a subject in an investigation.

lisa murkowski should switch her political affiliation and leave the gop. her values and voice clearly aren‚Äôt respected by the right. democrats would welcome her with open arms. https://t.co/ipxbm3sprv

*a conservative spills coffee while driving to work alone* 

conservative: ‚Äúdammit, george soros, why did you do that?!‚Äù

@barkflight if manchin votes yes, you‚Äôd actually need 3. 49 dems + 2 gop because pence is the tiebreaker.

@coastalelite28 we‚Äôve seen the senate democrats get stabbed in the back before (by joe lieberman, for example).

@coastalelite28 it‚Äôs not at all. in terms of their political future, reelection is likely easier for collins and murkowski if they vote no, for manchin if he votes yes. they have been meeting for a while, presumably to discuss these possibilities.

so actually two jobs 

@changethelausd hopefully my point was not misunderstood. i am not sure how much liberals can affect collins and flake, but we should be able to get manchin to no like we did all the other red-state dems. but we should flood all of them with dissent.

@coastalelite28 he could. collins and murkowski could both be a no and manchin could allow that to happen and help kavanaugh still get confirmed.

also bombard jeff flake and susan collins. we still need one of them to vote no along with murkowski and manchin to stop kavanaugh. keep the phones ringing...

collins: 202-224-2523

flake: 202-224-4521

manchin: 202-224-3954

@ragekittyin280 exactly! heitkamp showed that doing the unselfish thing, what‚Äôs best for our society, is more important than your political ‚Äúbrand.‚Äù plus it is unlikely to even hurt him much.

lisa murkowski is a no (!) on cloture vote...

but joe manchin is a yes.

kavanaugh‚Äôs confirmation could come down to his vote. over the next 24 hours, we have one job: to make manchin vote no. email, call, protest, signal boost, let‚Äôs make some damn noise.

@jordanuhl that‚Äôs a pretty big house for a tortoise.

ps - avenatti/cuomo 2020. i‚Äôm dead. üíÄ

mitch mcconnell says the ‚Äúkeystone cops were on the case,‚Äù joking about the media and liberals seeking the truth about the kavanaugh allegations. pretty rich coming from one of the leaders of the party that wasted 2 1/2 years on benghazi and elected a birther president.

franken did the right thing and took full responsibility for his wrongdoings. that makes a man-child like trump uncomfortable because he's never been accountable at any point in his life. https://t.co/dlpu5m6212

brett kavanaugh‚Äôs wall street journal op-ed is worthless. sorry, but you don‚Äôt get take backsies after going full breitbart and yelling conspiracy theories about the clintons.

less than five weeks until election day, but that‚Äôs misleading because in trump time it‚Äôs the equivalent of about 57 years. hope we all make it!

@tonyposnanski flip texas blue and it‚Äôs game, set, match.

@chrisevans until today i was convinced that you were really captain america pretending to be chris evans.

republicans call delgado, a champion of women's rights, "sexist," but claim brett kavanaugh, who has treated women terribly and wants to reverse roe v wade, is someone who is pro-women because he has hired some women. it's bizarro world with these people.

the gop uses brett kavanaugh's time at yale to sell his bio and minimize his troubled past.

the gop ignores democrat antonio delgado's time at harvard and as a rhodes scholar to instead smear his brief rap career.

two sets of rules: one for white men. another for poc and women.

@luluramadan it‚Äôs interesting how so many republicans who are out of office have come out against the current gop. makes you wonder how much the donors are really the ones behind the wheel.

someone needs to invent a rick santorum-proof remote control wrap so when he comes on cnn and you involuntarily chuck your remote at the tv nothing breaks.

john cornyn comparing the senate gop to atticus finch as they force an alleged serial sexual predator onto the supreme court is a seriously fucked up thing to say even for a republican.

@kathygriffin @chuckgrassley @orrinhatch @johncornyn @thomtillis @senmikelee @bensasse @tedcruz @mikecrapo @senjohnkennedy @senatemajldr @lindseygrahamsc self-proclaimed ‚Äúsingle white male‚Äù lindsey graham might like that offer.

chuck grassley is yelling about wanting to reset the senate‚Äôs supreme court process to be more ‚Äúcollegial.‚Äù 

complete bullshit.

you can‚Äôt block a legitimate judge and confirm two illegitimate ones, then demand that everyone plays nice again once you get what you want.

mitch mcconnell says democrats always have ‚Äúa reason why the goalposts need to be moved further down the field.‚Äù hard to hear from someone who verbally committed to ruining barack obama right after he took office and consistently changed the rules in an attempt to do it.

heidi heitkamp voting no on kavanaugh was a much harder decision than the one joe manchin is still facing, considering she might lose her race and he is ahead pretty big in the polls. he needs to step up. now.

@jimcarrey senator flake. the most appropriately named senator in us history.

senator tim scott says he‚Äôs ‚Äúmore comfortable‚Äù after the #fbireport. republicans were always going to say that. this whole thing was a setup. it wasn‚Äôt a thorough investigation and everybody knows it.

doxxing is wrong regardless of who does it. but the majority of political doxxing has been done by the far right. it‚Äôs super annoying to see conservatives rage now that a sheila jackson lee intern has done it after ignoring the countless liberals who have previously been doxxed.

note to the eventual 2020 dem nominee: if you want voters to see trump at his ugliest and most off message, remind him that he‚Äôs only rich because of his dad. that‚Äôs what was behind his rage in mississippi.

the election is 5 weeks away. if trump had actually accomplished something for working-class americans during his first two years he wouldn‚Äôt be mocking christine blasey ford and ranting about andrew jackson during rallies. he‚Äôd be bragging.

‚Äúi'm a big andrew jackson fan.‚Äù - trump

a. jackson was a white nationalist who had about 300 slaves and believed in ethnic cleansing.

b. steve bannon started this fixation.

c. it undercuts the right-wing argument that dems are bad because jackson, who died in 1845, was racist.

@joanwalsh @senatemajldr this is a microcosm of the republican party. he ignores women of color asking him about sexual assault for two minutes but immediately jumps at the chance to shake a white man's hand. wtf?

now that paul manafort has found a new hobby in singing, it was nice of him to give robert mueller and his team a private concert. bet he even broke out the ostrich jacket.

the gop tax scam helped the wealthiest americans buy private jets and extra yachts, then stuck poor and middle-class americans with the bill.

they call it trickle-down economics, but all the wealth goes up.

@jasimanski @kimreynoldsia @jackwhitver it‚Äôs a lot like the worst of corporate america. new regime comes in and makes bold promises, gets rich and kicks the can down the road so the next regime has to deal with the fallout. democrats almost always clean up these messes in government.

seven members of nevada republican governor candidate adam laxalt's family criticized him at his democratic opponent's fundraiser.

this isn‚Äôt cherrypicking either. the tea party experiment in kansas, for example, was even more disastrous than oklahoma‚Äôs failure.

california gov jerry brown turned a $17b deficit inherited from arnold schwarzenegger into a $9b surplus.

oklahoma gov mary fallin recklessly cut taxes causing steep budget cuts. communities and public services suffered.

@casekaem saw that! i think california can win and regardless we have to appreciate the governor of our biggest state acting like a major leader should.

california governor jerry brown just passed significant gun reform legislation, restored #netneutrality in his state, and signed into law a ‚Äúgender equality‚Äù bill requiring corporate boards to include women. in one weekend brown made more progress than trump has in two years!

if jeff flake helps get an fbi investigation, great, he finally did his damn job. but there‚Äôs no pulling the country back together after all the shit the right has pulled. birtherism, merrick garland, benghazi/email hit jobs, trump, kavanaugh, etc. that bridge has been torched.

add supreme court justice clarence thomas to this list as well. he never should‚Äôve made scotus.

let‚Äôs take this one step further. supreme court justice neil gorsuch was nominated to a stolen seat by an unindicted co-conspirator in federal crimes. an asterisk will also always be next to his name.

chris coons nailed it. if confirmed, supreme court justice brett kavanaugh will forever have an asterisk by his name.

red-state dems on kavanaugh:

@tarasetmayer jones said no last night.

@poetofscience i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs one or the other. perhaps a harris or warren or booker or beto can pull pretty damn hard left without feeling extreme.

amy klobuchar is fantastic. super underrated. do worry that she‚Äôs too moderate. this country is leaning far right, which has been a disaster for most americans, and we need someone who can pull it hard towards the other direction. https://t.co/lq7jnkdkpw

jeff flake is running for president on the boring trump platform. "i promise to give you all the same terrible policies without the embarrassing behavior."

@schmammie68 in fairness, that was amy klobuchar‚Äôs voice saying it is ‚Äúunfair‚Äù and mazie hirono made quite the statement as well right before booker was up. blumenthal called to subpoena mark judge. most are fighting like hell.

@scentsyjules no. republicans had 11 votes. there is nothing they could do other than express their disgust for this entire process.

the senate judiciary committee moves to vote on kavanaugh. cory booker and kamala harris refused to vote as a protest. watch them stare a hole through their republican colleagues for going through with this bs. https://t.co/egsucmoahw

brett kavanaugh let us in on his secret today... https://t.co/dpewpbcmhj

hey, red-state democratic senators, doug jones just showed you how easy it is to vote no on kavanaugh. he‚Äôs a historically unpopular nominee. most voters won‚Äôt even care. find your spine and do the right thing.

- serial sexual assaulter 
- proven liar
- worked for bush, starr
- picked to overturn roe v wade
- by potus under investigation

if donnelly and manchin can‚Äôt vote against that, what are they good for? they‚Äôre not democrats and should be booted from the party.

cnn is reporting that manchin is meeting with collins, flake and murkowski. it better be to convince them to vote no or this is not cool.

brett kavanaugh says it 100% didn't happen.

christine blasey ford says it 100% did happen.

republicans better hope kavanaugh didn't commit perjury because when democrats regain power, they will find out the truth come hell or high water.

@scout_finch that question no longer carries much weight after evangelicals hugged trump.

@russian_starr he knew better than to try her!

@realdonaldtrump if this is a total sham then donald trump should order an fbi investigation and prove it. if trump doesn‚Äôt do that, this is a cover up!

kamala harris refused to let brett kavanaugh off the hook. he obviously doesn‚Äôt want an fbi investigation and she proved it. #kavanaughhearings

similar to how he made amber guyger the victim for murdering botham jean, ted cruz is somehow making brett kavanaugh the victim and not his multiple accusers. time to vote cruz out 40 days from now!

@presssec @lindseygrahamsc sarah sanders wouldn‚Äôt know what decency meant if the definition was tattooed on her forehead.

notice how brett kavanaugh gets extra interrupty when women question him.

the gop expects christine blasey ford to remember everything that happened 36 years ago when they can‚Äôt even remember what they did to merrick garland two years ago. #kavanaughhearings

ben sasse is nothing more than midwest jeff flake. talks a big game but falls in line like all the other republicans.

since chuck grassley brought up the letter with the signatures of 65 women who knew kavanaugh in high school, how did he immediately produce that right after ford‚Äôs allegations became known? the gop knew about these scandals. they are playing dumb.

this lindsey graham temper tantrum is one of the most inappropriate things you will ever see from a senator. flipping out to try to shut down both accusers and his dem colleagues was unsafe and unprofessional. #kavanaughhearings https://t.co/zx0eslzylk

‚Äúi‚Äôm hear to answer questions about my yearbook... or sports... or summer league basketball...‚Äù

kavanaugh just morphed into steve carell‚Äôs character from anchorman.

john cornyn comparing this to the mccarthy hearings is laughable. he and the gop have enabled a sexual predator and ‚Äúserial liar‚Äù president. they have zero credibility here.

no, lindsey graham, this isn‚Äôt hell. your re-election campaign in 2020 is going to be hell.

geez. chuck grassley swooped in to save kavanaugh from that dick durbin question faster than a superhero catching someone falling from a building. republicans really don‚Äôt want an fbi investigation.

senator patrick leahy brings up mark judge‚Äôs book about wild times with friends like kavanaugh called ‚Äúwasted: tales of a genx drunk.‚Äù 

gee, wouldn‚Äôt that guy be a useful witness today?

imagine if a woman scotus nominee gave kavanaugh‚Äôs opening statement. 

the conservative reaction would be:

‚Äúwhy is she so angry?‚Äù

‚Äúwhy doesn‚Äôt she smile more?‚Äù

‚Äúshe‚Äôs too emotional.‚Äù

#kavanaughhearings

republicans: ‚Äúliberal judges need to put aside their ideology and stop legislating from the bench.‚Äù

also republicans: ‚Äúwe see no problem with judge kavanaugh attacking democrats on national tv.‚Äù

@tonyposnanski why doesn‚Äôt he smile more???

practically yelling at us.

defensively lashing out.

blaming random people.

ya know, brett kavanaugh, that opening statement was exactly how you‚Äôd expect a guilty person to act. #kavanaughhearings

shorter kavanaugh: ‚Äúi like sports. i like beer. i like church. i hate the clintons.‚Äù

he obviously just got done reading ‚Äúfox news for dummies.‚Äù

@adixarmy yeah, absolutely, she‚Äôs a badass. my issue was with the booker diss.

brett kavanaugh might be new to the national spotlight, but he‚Äôs already learned the trick to making sure conservatives support you regardless of how bad your actions are: when all else fails blame the clintons.

just because cory booker is kind and optimistic doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs ‚Äúsoft.‚Äù he‚Äôs a former college football player who was the subject of a political documentary called street fight. https://t.co/brdfyaybnx

@robboffard @toxik_artemis @missnicoletta i like a lot of things about tulsi but the support for assad might be a dealbreaker. don‚Äôt get that at all.

every time kamala harris gets her turn at one of these hearings, it becomes clear why she is the 2020 contender donald trump never ever mentions. he‚Äôs terrified and should be. she‚Äôs a force of nature.

mazie hirono battled for sick and poor people to have health care coverage while she fought her own stage four cancer. she‚Äôs a terrific senator who relentlessly fights for everyday folks, especially those who are victims or are discriminated against. https://t.co/spcmqzjmeb

@aal02115 haha! 100% accurate.

amy klobuchar is not here for grassley‚Äôs bs. that was an awesome real-time fact check stating that george h.w. bush reopened the anita hill investigation.

a wee bit hypocritical considering the senate gop has spent the past 2 years interrupting kamala harris. https://t.co/5ueue5pyfl

@jljacobson oh yeah. big time. in my replies and just doing a search of terms like act, acting, performance, etc. they are even saying acting runs in the family because of i believe her niece.

@jasperjaseyrae she‚Äôs under oath. same difference.

@toyarico @kimmasters we need to make sure of that by staying on donnelly and manchin!

conservatives claim dr. christine blasey ford is acting. so you‚Äôre saying in between getting all those degrees and her career and her having a family she was secretly training to be meryl streep because one day she might need to use that stealth acting ability in court? riiiight.

chuck grassley has a woman surrogate ask his questions for him and then cuts her off midway through her first question to speed up getting this male nominee confirmed. wow.

don‚Äôt know how anybody could watch dr. ford‚Äôs opening statement and not believe her. she‚Äôs clearly traumatized and scared, you can tell her life has been unfairly turned upside down, but you can also see the sense of duty compelling her to speak up anyway. #kavanaughhearings

@jlmrojas @alt_deptofed i totally agree! it doesn‚Äôt matter who victims are, they should be heard. it is just especially troubling to see the way she has been smeared.

good for sen. feinstein for making sure to introduce dr. christine blasey ford as extremely accomplished and impressive. this is a very serious person who has a lot to lose by coming forward. right-wing america has completely misrepresented this strong and credible woman.

11 men make up the republican side of the senate judiciary committee. why are there no women? there are six gop women senators. they wouldn‚Äôt even make room for one. this is especially problematic on a day like today. #kavanaughhearings

the gop uses george washington to excuse sexual assault, abe lincoln to excuse racism and ronald reagan to excuse its russia behavior. 

if these dead presidents were hear to speak for themselves they‚Äôd probably say leave us out of this shit.

not so fast, trump. chuck grassley has the signatures of 65 women who swear george washington was a good man. he was around back then to gather them himself.

trump is trying to preemptively scapegoat china for the gop‚Äôs upcoming election losses while validating his reckless trade war and minimizing russian interference. he‚Äôs not nearly as slick as he thinks he is.

last night, tucker carlson said, "if bernie madoff rips you off and you don‚Äôt tell his other investors, you‚Äôre part of the problem, are you not?‚Äù to defend kavanaugh and attack his accusers.

@sci_teacher117 appreciate it. updated my original with another tweet. i bet grassley, hatch and the rest of that crew put a lot of pressure on her after that fbi comment came out.

@sci_teacher117 huh. i didn't see that yet. where did you see that news? thanks!

realize mitch mcconnell and the rest of the out-of-touch old men in the senate gop hate listening to women, but they should listen to their republican colleague lisa murkowski. she says there needs to be an fbi investigation into the kavanaugh allegations and she's 100% correct.

donald trump is a mad dog chasing cars in a traffic jam.

this is why mcconnell is at least as bad as trump, if not worse.

@senatemajldr if mitch mcconnell was really so sure that kavanaugh is innocent he would slow down the confirmation process so facts would emerge and exonerate kavanaugh. he‚Äôs behaving like the lawyer of a guilty defendant.

bill shine and the white house called in martha maccallum from the fox news bullpen to do some emergency damage control. hope she really warmed up her arm and shoulder before having to throw kavanaugh all those softballs.

rod rosenstein is now scheduled to meet with trump on thursday, according to sarah sanders. 

hmmm. what else is happening thursday? oh yeah, christine blasey ford is testifying that day. 

it‚Äôs now obvious that the white house is trying to distract us from kavanaugh‚Äôs scandals.

amber guyger, the dallas cop who murdered botham jean, has been fired. hopefully the next news we get about her will be that she has been found guilty. https://t.co/oq2ufm1ah0

once again, donald trump is having john kelly do his dirty work and fire rod rosenstein while he's out of town. his voters see him as this tough, strong leader, but he's actually a coward who's afraid to confront people face to face.

before we blame journalists for this rod rosenstein fiasco, let‚Äôs recall that trying to accurately cover this dishonest clusterfuck of a white house is about as easy as trying to give someone a tattoo on a roller coaster. also important: trump wants people to turn on the press.

sounds like rod rosenstein is getting fired. there‚Äôs conflicting news, but what‚Äôs clear is trump is pushing him out. the president is going to try to end the mueller probe and everyone has to unite to stop him. including republicans who are patriots, if there‚Äôs any of you left.

@anncoulter conservative meltdowns &gt; liberal tears

@mschlapp ah, yes, merrick garland is going to sit on the supreme court bench tomorrow and have a good chuckle with colleagues about how easy of a time he had as a nominee.

@jessefferguson @nate_cohn yup. pete sessions is a human marijuana roadblock that must be removed. he's one of the worst politicians in the history of texas politics. dangerously outdated pov. time for him to go!

this is the year republicans became so dishonest they tried to act like even bob woodward and ronan farrow were fake news. it doesn‚Äôt matter how impeccable your reporting is, the right will smear you if it helps them.

@irin @scarletm1926 thanks for clarifying. i almost did the same thing so totally understandable. easy to get confused with so many cases that are pretty similar.

@scarletm1926 definitely. i wanted to make sure i didn‚Äôt get it wrong because of the nature of the subject.

@scarletm1926 after doing some more investigating, i think that was the jane poe case. this is azar v. garza, jane doe. there‚Äôs also a jane moe and jane roe. it‚Äôs confusing and want to make sure i get it right, but someone just sent this to me... https://t.co/q2tydb2avt

@susanemoney there is also a jane moe and a jane roe case. please let me know if anyone has that info so i can update the original tweet. the closest i‚Äôve found was a think progress article stating that how jane doe became pregnant wasn‚Äôt revealed, but it could‚Äôve been due to rape.

@susanemoney want to make sure we are talking about the same case ‚Äî azar vs. garza, with jane doe. haven‚Äôt been able to find a source revealing why she was pregnant. maybe i‚Äôm just confused? there are a bunch of these cases, which is infuriating, and they often involve rape. like jane poe.

kavanaugh wanted to block a 17-year-old girl from having an abortion, which would‚Äôve affected her for the rest of her life. yet conservatives don‚Äôt want to hold kavanaugh to his own standard, aruguing choices he made when he was 17 shouldn‚Äôt affect him for life. seems unfair.

bernard lafayette, a civil rights movement leader, said muhammad ali's vietnam protest helped inspire mlk to oppose the war publicly. ted cruz claiming mlk wouldn't support nfl player protests of social injustice is as dishonest as it gets. #txsenatedebate https://t.co/d2uuhszzyz

@eileendefreest @mollyjongfast @maggieserota ted cruz is a shower-drain hairball eaten by a dog and vomited back up.

chuck grassley is lucky we can‚Äôt invoke the 25th amendment on him. https://t.co/gnqml3glce

rewatched the #txsenatedebate.

we've heard so much hype about cruz's debate skills, but he was more lyin' ted than debate champ. he kept misrepresenting beto's record and was misleading in every answer.

beto stuck to facts and passionately offered solutions to help all texans.

after beto o‚Äôrourke genuinely complimented ted cruz, cruz responded with basically ‚Äúbeto believes in socialism as much as bernie.‚Äù which he clearly meant as a smear, not a compliment. this is why people hate you, ted cruz. you are smug, cold and maybe not human. #txsenatedebate

beto o‚Äôrourke reminds us that he‚Äôs visited all the counties in texas (there‚Äôs 254) and burns ted cruz for not doing that. cruz instead visited all 99 counties in iowa because he was more focused on being president than helping tx. #txsenatedebate
https://t.co/x7rm5kmys6

beto o‚Äôrourke eloquently roasts ted cruz over why we must stand up to donald trump. (@texastribune) https://t.co/snmw2ju4gc

‚Äúthoughts and prayers, senator cruz, are just not gonna cut it any more. the children of texas deserve action.‚Äù -beto o‚Äôrourke nailed it on school shootings and gun reform. #txsenatedebate

and then ted cruz mentioned hillary clinton 2x again in the follow-up!

why is ted cruz mentioning hillary clinton 2x in one answer in a 2018 debate? this is the problem with republicans; they can‚Äôt look forward, only backward. #txsenatedebate

ted cruz says part of why he‚Äôs a republican is because the dixiecrats were racist 50+ years ago and that makes the gop the actual party of equal rights. is he high? #txsenatedebate

ted cruz was asked if police brutality against the black community is a problem and he didn‚Äôt even consider it for a second before firing back with basically cops can do no wrong. he wouldn‚Äôt even acknowledge the issue. so gross. #txsenatedebate

beto o‚Äôrourke beat ted cruz on the dreamers exchange. cruz literally said ‚Äúlegal good, illegal bad,‚Äù while o‚Äôrourke stated that not only would deporting millions of people hurt us morally, it would hurt america financially as well. #txsenatedebate

it‚Äôs ridiculous that ted cruz forced friday night rush hour during texas high school football season. he doesn‚Äôt want people to see this. #txsenatedebate

looks like kevin cramer is this election‚Äôs todd akin. really dumb gaffe considering heidi heitkamp might be the most vulnerable democratic senator. https://t.co/trx3ehhkfy

#txsenatedebate prediction: beto o‚Äôrourke will come out focused on the issues and ted cruz will immediately hide behind petty insults and culture wars. it‚Äôs what cruz has done his entire campaign. he can‚Äôt win on substance.

@menks101 thanks for adding that. couldn't really fit it into the tweet. probably pretty smart to test drive the new look before committing, right?

@mcoleen75 exactly.

rod rosenstein is a life-long republican who was nominated by the current republican president. those are facts, inconvenient as they might be to the right. if rosenstein is fired it will be because he refused to be a partisan hack. full stop.

this news is like, ‚Äúwell, sure the president is crazy, everybody knows that, but is he trying to fire rosenstein?‚Äù omg how did we get to this place.

regardless of why this rod rosenstein  story happened, think about this: the 25th amendment aspect never would‚Äôve got any traction with clinton, bush or obama, all three hated by many, because they weren‚Äôt mentally unstable.

@realsporkman for sure. that's why i made the point for trump's cabinet instead of him. countless members have splurged on private jet rides when it was completely unnecessary. regardless, this is what an actual populist president looks like.

mexican president-elect andr√©s manuel l√≥pez obrador travels via commercial flights and plans to sell the presidential plane. even getting stuck on a tarmac for 3 hours due to weather didn't change his mind. trump's cabinet could learn a lot from this man. https://t.co/pklt2ezokp

- stop gop from killing aca
- start impeachment

heidi heitkamp, joe donnelly and joe manchin voted for gorsuch. if you live in north dakota, indiana or west virginia pester your senator to make sure they also commit to voting no on kavanaugh. they are off the hook here. if anything a no vote will help their re-election bids.

thank you, claire mccaskill! voting no on kavanaugh is the correct thing to do morally and now politically given his unpopularity. time for other red-state dem senators to follow her lead.

@fawfulfan @pjtec @cemcemmo also the previous dem got into big trouble, which played a role. worried about voter suppression, too. but no matter how you spin it it makes me worried about turnout in seven weeks. this election gives r‚Äôs the seat through 2020. not good.

@tigerli57435526 i would guess that something in between is probably the right number heading into the three debates. which will be very important. then again, i thought wendy davis destroyed greg abbott in their 2014 debates and it didn‚Äôt matter.

almost don‚Äôt want to pass along this encouraging news given gop voter suppression and other democrat turnout issues, but a reuters poll has andrew gillum up 6 and beto o‚Äôrourke up for the first time by 2. dems can win these races if we get out the vote. https://t.co/7umb4uwqb3

susan collins didn‚Äôt ask for al franken and his accusers to testify, she pushed him out of the senate. it wasn‚Äôt even a year ago. she should also push kavanaugh out. anything less than that is a partisan flip-flop. https://t.co/mw6rhgudk2

@tidalwave2018 i think that ship has sailed but we should keep pressuring them anyway. it would be insane for even a red-state dem to vote to confirm now.

not sure if kavanaugh will lose a seat on scotus due to this scandal, but if he doesn‚Äôt some republicans will lose their seats in the senate. not just collins or murkowski either. ernst, gardner, heller, perdue, tillis... anybody who‚Äôs vulnerable in 2018/2020 will have to answer.

bob corker, another complicit republican who plays a never trumper for the media, says he wants the vote to be postponed. hopefully he holds instead of folds for once. https://t.co/zab2ouipge

jeff flake breaking from his party on this kavanaugh scandal seems like a positive development, and it could be, but remember he's been the king of saying one thing publicly then privately doing the opposite during the trump era.

hard to take conservatives demanding ‚Äúdue process‚Äù to protect their own seriously when they‚Äôve been chanting ‚Äúlock her up‚Äù for three years.

27 years after anita hill bravely came forward, christine blasey ford bravely comes forward giving the senate gop a chance to start to right their wrongs. unfortunately, they haven‚Äôt learned anything since then, even during #metoo. trump, roy moore, jim jordan, etc. prove that.

@sarcasmstardust not really. who‚Äôs to say those dems who voted for bush weren‚Äôt aging or disgruntled moderates who permanently left the party after starr/gingrich nonsense? i know nader voters who became democrats again. i don‚Äôt know one bush voter who has.

@freedomrideblog they are still doing that today by multiple means of voter suppression. this thread was about the green party, which i don‚Äôt consider to be a serious one at all, but as i‚Äôve said before non-voters, democrats who left the party and the gop stealing the election were also problems.

@bill_fj_quinn that‚Äôs the thing. i knew no matter who i picked ‚Äî gandhi, mlk, etc. ‚Äî people would have something to say. it‚Äôs just the way twitter is, for better or worse.

@kellix4 @marilynlouise5 exactly. how else could the cleveland browns survive winning one game and two seasons?

@statistar30 you can blame them too as well as people who lean left and didn‚Äôt vote. i would argue that many of those voters were moderate and probably ditched dems for good, where as green party voters are definitely left. also didn‚Äôt have enough characters to state the election was stolen.

stop using sewers &amp; street lights, getting mail, visiting parks, collecting social security, sending kids to public school, supporting the pentagon, utilizing fema... can do this all day. americans love socialism, need it to balance capitalism run amok even if they don‚Äôt know it.

to right-wing socialism haters: set your home on fire breaking a keurig or burning nikes? no firefighters for you. need to rush a loved one to a hospital? no public roads. and stop calling cops on black people for no reason because being able to do that for free is socialist too.

@macasu i know at least 6 nader voters who now vote straight-ticket democrat. it seems like a pretty common metamorphosis for young voters to start green and then change to blue.

@ayoedebiri @gaybonez what i was trying to do was explain my full position to those i don‚Äôt think understood my intent. perhaps to a fault. i‚Äôm passionate about this stuff. i have no problem shutting up and listening. of course a marginalized person will have better insight on being marginalized.

@ayoedebiri @gaybonez i read the article. i thought the clapping hands meme was from popular culture but appreciate the history there and i have no problem at all with no longer using it. offending anyone is the exact opposite of my intent here.

@ayoedebiri @gaybonez it‚Äôs fine and i would be happy to take a read! honestly, i am totally open to criticism and always am looking for feedback. wasn‚Äôt trying to be defensive just misread your response as making fun of me i suppose. sorry for anything on my end and thanks for elaborating.

@gaybonez @ayoedebiri i‚Äôm not trying to tone police anybody at all and if that‚Äôs how it came off i apologize. definitely not my intent. i‚Äôm trying to have a respectful dialogue and see if some of us on the left can discuss and dissent even if we aren‚Äôt 100% on the same page.

@gaybonez @ayoedebiri i‚Äôm just trying to listen, understand other people‚Äôs point of view. i‚Äôve been having these discussions on this for the past few because i feel while a lot of people agreed with me, others thought my approach was off. the left is diverse and people will naturally disagree, right?

@gaybonez @ayoedebiri the ‚Äúclapping back‚Äù irony bit was uncalled for imo because before that it all seemed cordial. i didn‚Äôt throw anybody under the bus. we seem to disagree on how effective my calling out of trump‚Äôs policies and smears was. that‚Äôs fine. it can be beneficial to debate this stuff out.

@ayoedebiri @gaybonez i‚Äôll totally listen to you and anybody else. always do, unless it‚Äôs a bad-faith far-right opinion from somebody. but that‚Äôs hard to do when you are kinda talking trash on me and making it personal.

@gaybonez @ayoedebiri cool. i‚Äôm fighting right-wing bullshit the way i think will work but y‚Äôall do you. take care. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

p.s. - dems also shouldn't run a politically inexperienced tv lawyer just because he gets under trump's thin orange skin.

@barackdavote i would use the term ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù there not centrist, which has a much more negative connotation. and i get that in some instances dems have no choice but to match constituents, even if they try to pull them left a bit.

howard schultz? no
jamie dimon? no
mark cuban? no
mark zuckerberg? no
michael bloomberg? no

too early to say who democrats should run in 2020, but here's who they shouldn't run: centrist billionaires.

@gaybonez fighting trump is just today's fight. of course. all i said was that these disgusting policies are terrible but we need at least some laws, while clapping back at the way the right uses "open borders" as a smear on both immigrants and those who want humane immigration policies.

@gaybonez i'm trying to refute xenophobia and racism. the right uses "open borders" as a pejorative to misrepresent the truth about immigrants -- as a whole, they commit less crime than native citizens -- and paint the left as lawless anarchists. they aren't talking about having open arms.

@jpbrammer don't think you are. it's appalling how mexican americans have been treated by this admin, and there's lots for our country to be ashamed of in regard to how we treat/treated different groups. just don't see a way to retroactively ditch borders/all laws in a way that makes sense.

@jpbrammer the right uses "open borders" to smear the left as anarchists. was refuting that, pointing out how dumb thier racist policies are. my position isn't "less cages" it's let everyone in who wants to be here but let's have some rules to keep everyone safe and help immigrants succeed.

gop az senate candidate martha mcsally is smearing democratic opponent kyrsten sinema for protesting the iraq war. it's almost 2019! how do republicans still not realize that voters see opposing that trash war as a positive, not a negative?  https://t.co/7wamkxzbvm

everyone is jumping on the price of the curtains, but it seems they were approved before nikki haley‚Äôs time. here‚Äôs the thing: we don‚Äôt need lavish curtains to prove someone willing to work for trump is not a good person. https://t.co/ixaomtpxqq

@justkelly_ok @hector_e_alcala @poverotti or even a majority of people who lean left.

@justkelly_ok @hector_e_alcala @poverotti jesus. it has nothing to do with that. i‚Äôm not assuming. i‚Äôm going off polling. show me a poll where a majority of americans want no immigration laws.

@hector_e_alcala @justkelly_ok @poverotti our current system is racist. that was sort of the point of the tweet. the wall is racist. all i‚Äôm saying is republicans think liberals and the left don‚Äôt want any laws here whatsoever. that is the position of very few people, even those of us who want to take everyone in.

so, tucker, if michael avenatti is the ‚Äúcreepy porn laywer,‚Äù donald trump must be the ‚Äúsleazy payoff president.‚Äù

@shaunking the dinos faced an extinction level event.

@giltpolitics i'm not in ny. but, yeah, to keep a republican out of office i would have to vote for democrats i don't like given where the gop is at. i wouldn't be thrilled about it but what choice do we have? fortunately there aren't that many i dislike.

andrew cuomo might've won tonight, but the good news is that the entire country saw him run a dirty race and now he has no chance in hell of even being considered for 2020.

@justkelly_ok @poverotti agree to disagree? i think you have to dismantle their framing forcefully.

@justkelly_ok @poverotti hey, now. that‚Äôs unfair as hell. criminal immigrants ‚Äî which i‚Äôve already stated commit less crimes than native citizens, but do sometimes exist and there‚Äôs no denying that fact ‚Äî could be from anywhere, including white supremacists from europe. this thread is getting ridiculous.

@danrather thank you! dark moments in american history like this call for all of us to speak out. this is not and cannot be normal.

@jonfavs ditto.

@radiofreetom breaking bad should be an alias for fox news.

tadd fujikawa just became the first male pro golfer to publicly identify as gay. gotta appreciate him showing such bravery and paving the way for lgbtq youth. https://t.co/iwkbmdwzl3

@poverotti @justkelly_ok immigrants, documented or undocumented, commit less crime than native citizens. fact. also is a fact that occasionally some immigrants commit crimes, are dangerous. the right ridiculously mischaracterizes this, lives in fantasyland, but so do people who think there are no issues.

@poverotti @justkelly_ok sigh. i'm constantly talking about framing and not confirming to right-wing talking points. the entire point here was to shoot down that "open borders" smear. also, i'm for abolishing ice, single-payer, super strict gun laws, etc... if i'm not "left" than left is a tiny group.

@justkelly_ok maybe i misread your intent? sorry if i did. a bit defensive here because i feel the tweet is being misrepresented by many on the left. people are acting like i‚Äôm not far enough left on this issue when in reality if i went any further left i‚Äôd be for no laws whatsoever.

"nra puts kkk hoods on cartoon trains to mock diversity" sounds like a parody of right-wing america but no these gun-lobby ghouls actually did that shit. https://t.co/tyi2u3poem

@justkelly_ok i wouldn't assume that it would. i just think some people have mischaracterized the tweet. to the right "open borders" means no laws, no rules, anarchy. i'm for a welcoming immigration system that is humane and doesn't discriminate, but we do have to have at least some rules.

@justkelly_ok how many times must i explain this to fellow lefties? i want everyone who wants to be here and doesn't have a dangerous track record to be here. that's almost all immigrants. i was refuting conservatives framing the left as lawless and being supportive of terrorism and gangs.

more proof that this allegation, unfortunately, won't matter: the gop confirmed clarence thomas almost 30 years ago. they dgaf and never really have.

crazy as it sounds, a potential brett kavanaugh sexual misconduct scandal won‚Äôt even make senate republicans flinch. they would confirm hannibal lecter if it meant overturning roe v wade, trampling on civil rights and protecting corporations over people.

this blunder alone proves that the donald isn‚Äôt some political mastermind playing 4d chess like his worshippers tend to believe.

trump‚Äôs disgusting lie about the hurricane maria death toll could be bad news for gop candidates like rick scott and ron desantis. fl is home to over 1m puerto ricans, a number that increased by 50-75k after the storm.

@_justinwelch_ @soulkhan the issue here is that conservatives use the ‚Äúopen borders‚Äù term to imply democrats/liberals/leftists want no laws and openly encourage violent bad actors to enter our society. open arms does not mean complete lawlessness, like they infer.

benghazi: 4 americans died. conservatives obsess over it for 6 years because they claim hillary clinton messed up and lied about it.

puerto rico: 3,000 americans died. conservatives apparently don‚Äôt care at all that donald trump messed up and lied about it.

lying about puerto rico is like lying about 9/11. the same amount of americans died. donald trump is a hurricane maria truther. our commander-in-chief defamed thousands of victims for personal gain. the gop should march up to the white house and remove him. they have no spine.

um, who‚Äôs gonna tell mike huckabee that our current president makes slanderous accusations without checking the facts almost every single day? typically before most of the nation even wakes up. https://t.co/pbnnufjlcw

@soulkhan @rosswaldz open borders to right-wing america and the fox news crowd means lawlessness. that is the way they use it to smear the left. my original tweet was rebuking their bad-faith framing.

@soulkhan @rosswaldz i want to abolish ice, btw. i want everyone who wants to be here and to contribute to our country here. period. i just think we need some laws. call me crazy. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

@soulkhan @rosswaldz yes, undocumented and documented immigrants commit less crime than native citizens. i've stated that myself often. that doesn't mean there is no crime. all i'm saying is we need some rules and security. some documentation. i want us to have open arms, but i don't want anarchy.

republican campaigns all across the country are selling candidates as "pro-life" while the gop guts fema spending during hurricane season and sues to end coverage for pre-existing conditions. that's called false advertising.

@rosswaldz @soulkhan it means looking at the statistics to evaluate what is happening, then finding a safe, logical way to welcome all who want to be here. not using one tragedy to misrepresent what is happening with immigration. like mollie tibbetts. pretty damn clear what that means.

@nandelabra when right-wingers say ‚Äúopen borders‚Äù it‚Äôs a pejorative term that means no immigration rules whatsoever. it‚Äôs framing that i think is unfair fear-mongering. that was what i was speaking out against.

willie nelson is royalty in texas. him headlining a rally for beto o'rourke is a much bigger deal than your typical celebrity endorsement. https://t.co/yuve2oud0g

@nandelabra i want to abolish ice. i think the border crisis is manufactured. i‚Äôm very far left on immigration. i‚Äôm just not willing to say we don‚Äôt need any rules or security at all. sorry ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

@chairamaswamy @nandelabra i‚Äôm very far left on most issues. to me the terms mean essentially the same thing. let‚Äôs not split hairs here.

@nandelabra standing up to inhumane right-wing policies while stating we need some laws? i don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs wrong with that. i think we can be extremely welcoming to all who want to be here and still have some basic guidelines. i‚Äôm a leftist not an anarchist.

whenever a trump surrogate talks on cable news, plaid shirt guy should be green-screened into the background so there's a proper response to their bs.

this halloween display is accurate... https://t.co/lwbmgbolij

@soulkhan think you are misreading me. i want us to be welcoming and humane, but we have to have some security and laws, guided by data and compassion, of course, not fear and nationalism. if people want to be here in good faith there should be a path. 100%.

ted cruz pens a fox news article about the alamo. he continues to talk about anything and everything to avoid discussing issues currently affecting texas voters. https://t.co/ib3p4dphso

@goldengateblond his elementary teachers really failed him there. good lord.

then again, compare the swift reaction to hurricane harvey in tx -- a red state that voted for trump -- to his failed response to hurricane maria in pr -- a us territory where he lost a primary. the carolinas might be okay because they voted for him. but poor virginia is blue.

donald trump thinks allowing 3k people in puerto rico to die while throwing paper towels at victims like he was hosting the world's cruelest game show was "incredibly successful" makes you really scared for the people of the carolinas right about now.

instead of the trump admin reuniting migrant children with their families, the federal government is making the tent city in tornillo 10 times bigger. are texas republicans just going to sit back and watch their party treat innocent children like prisoners?

ex-nfl player and conservative author burgess owens goes on an insane rant on fox business and says nike's colin kaepernick ad is "like 9/11 and pearl harbor." sick to compare a freakin' shoe commercial to these national tragedies, especially a day before the anniversary of 9/11. https://t.co/badxy79axf

@janmackay it‚Äôs on tape. you can listen to it here. a commander-in-chief should never crack a joke like this while talking about dead american soldiers even if it is about the opposition. poor taste. https://t.co/qncbneekgw

when you look at all this stuff side-by-side, you clearly see that republicans and right-wing media manufactured a scandal with benghazi. democrats and liberal media wouldn‚Äôt and still won‚Äôt go there. it‚Äôs gross, puts dems in a tough spot since they are unwilling to stoop so low.

then there‚Äôs the embassy and consulate attacks that happened under george w. bush. politifact ruled 13 attacks and 60 dead during his tenure as ‚Äúmostly true‚Äù because those numbers were actually too low. fox news was awfully quiet about all those incidents. https://t.co/wtkqiqqtwi

let‚Äôs also not forget the botched yemen raid that cost ryan owens his life. even owens‚Äô father, a vet, thinks trump messed up: "it was a screw-up from the start that ended badly." https://t.co/9bmbpumbfx

benghazi was an actual witch hunt.

17 americans were killed in the beirut embassy while reagan was president. that received way less scrutiny.

historically speaking niger probably shouldn‚Äôt be a huge scandal, but the gop should be forced to play by the rules they established.

trump joked and his staff laughed while dealing with a niger ambush where 4 us soldiers died.

4 americans died in benghazi while a democrat was in the wh. republicans responded by spending 2 1/2 years, $7m investigating.

watch the gop not care this time because... partisanship.

@lars9596 @jack i draw the line at threatening violence and targeted harassment. there's a strong argument all that isn't covered by even 1a. people could get killed, which almost happened because of pizzagate. plus, the rest of us have to abide by the terms of service, why not him?

alex jones threatens violence, harasses people and defames victims. it‚Äôs not censorship for a company like twitter to decide not to give him or infowars a platform. they have a global community of more than 300m active users to protect. @jack gave him plenty of chances.

"people with no names are writing our nation's history." - melania trump

she is married to the guy who used fake names like john barron to rewrite his own history (like his net worth). these words ring hollow.

dear republican senators,

you don‚Äôt get to accuse democrats of being power-hungry politicians who want to be president while you go to great lengths to protect a power-hungry president.

sincerely,
common sense

@rangerrick99 hopefully that will change very soon. https://t.co/9rkgkvu5xt

ted cruz gets all the headlines, but this is a good moment to remind everyone that john cornyn is also a terrible us senator from texas.

@fawfulfan it‚Äôs early ‚Äî christie and paul were leading the gop pack now in 2014 i believe ‚Äî but they are showing they should be two of the candidates for sure. 100%.

@cooptroop820 she‚Äôs phenomenal, too. was just daydreaming about her mopping the debate stage with trump‚Äôs combover. https://t.co/jf9grb34b2

cory booker was the first senator to say a president under investigation shouldn‚Äôt get a scotus nominee. now he‚Äôs risking his own ass to release kavanaugh documents republicans were trying to hide. he‚Äôs been the democratic mvp of this supreme court process.

after seeing kamala harris absolutely school brett kavanaugh, hard not to daydream about her cleaning trump's clock on a debate stage.

@ivankatrump if you really expect us to believe that the white house is working to improve the lives of every american, it is you who needs to get out of your echo chamber.

#lodestar is a fitting alias for stupid watergate's version of deep throat.

if you captured the presidency using "people are saying" as your go-to phrase, you don't get to bitch about the new york times using anonymous sources.

@yashar yup. fake trail of breadcrumbs. didn‚Äôt anybody watch scooby-doo?

guessing the op-ed writer simply used ‚Äúlodestar‚Äù to throw people off their scent and onto mike pence‚Äôs. it‚Äôs not exactly hard to dupe this white house.

@realdonaldtrump yes, all signs point to treason. 

* asking russia to hack political opponent
* knowing son, son-in-law, campaign chair met w/ russians
* kissing putin's ass in helsinki
* refusing to agree with all intelligence agencies

after all those smears about hillary clinton‚Äôs well-being, conservatives elected an unhinged megalomaniac whose own cabinet has pondered using the 25th amendment to oust him. infuriating to watch trump turn out to be even worse than the right‚Äôs cartoonish interpretation of hrc.

my favorite part of the new colin kaepernick nike ad -- and the entire thing is inspiring af -- is this young boy wrestling despite not having legs. really puts most of our physical ailments in perspective. https://t.co/mkpddvvqkl

there is no liberal equivalent of alex jones. he's all the worst traits of modern conservatism rolled up into one garbage human being. our most brilliant fiction writers couldn't create a more damning right-wing caricature if they tried.

alex jones and marco rubio beefing is liberal fan fiction brought to life. somebody pinch me. can we get tomi lahren and rand paul screaming at each other for the undercard?

senator feinstein asks brett kavanaugh, "can a sitting president be required to respond to a subpoena?" watch him completely avoid answering a straightforward question. alarming given that trump's lawyers will likely fight a subpoena from the mueller probe.https://t.co/nhwu0qme2u

donald trump colored a blue stripe on the flag, doesn‚Äôt know the words to the national anthem and wouldn‚Äôt fly the flag half mast for a famous war hero. he has no credibility whatsoever on this subject. https://t.co/m9hxphwgen

ted cruz: my opponent says the f word and is a bad role model for kids.

also ted cruz: recently supported a pedophile in a us senate race.

can‚Äôt wait for day 2 of the brett kavanaugh hearings, when republicans reveal his shoe size, astrological sign and wi-fi password to avoid releasing documents or discussing issues, then turn around and attack democrats for not taking the process seriously enough.

we don‚Äôt need to compare ayanna pressley to any recent candidates or call her victory a sign that one wing of the democratic party is taking over. she‚Äôs just a damn good candidate who ran a terrific primary race.

@tonyposnanski 

@realdonaldtrump i mean, seriously, how can republicans argue that brett kavanaugh is getting treated unfairly after what they did to a highly qualified moderate scotus nominee two years ago?

"no one can beat him in 2020 ‚Äì not even close." - sarah sanders

trump is the subject of an investigation and has a disapproval rating of 60%. the white house shouldn't even be confident about him making it to 2020.

@fred_guttenberg beyond shameful. the nra apparently doesn't just own conservative politicians, but conservative judges, too.

good luck smearing living legend bob woodward as ‚Äúfake news,‚Äù conservatives. your go-to move for silencing trump reports won‚Äôt work this time. would be like calling martin scorsese a hack or saying anna wintour has bad taste.

hope ted cruz thoroughly enjoys his last #scotus hearing because we are voting his ass out in two months.

@susandoyle1963 i live in texas and agree that was completely pointless.

dems: we have serious concerns about brett kavanaugh. assault rifles. women‚Äôs rights. his view that a sitting president can‚Äôt be indicted.

gop: but he eats his pasta with ketchup and coaches basketball!

chuck grassley will go down in infamy for his behavior in this supreme court nomination process. he‚Äôs pretended like this is ‚Äúregular order‚Äù when it‚Äôs the furthest thing from that. keep hitting back hard, senate democrats.

kavanaugh - unpopular far-right judge nominated by president who lost the popular vote and is being investigated. hearing rammed through without transparency.

garland - popular moderate judge nominated by scandal-free president who easily won 2 elections. never received hearing.

@tonyposnanski good idea... but jay and beyonc√© performed for hillary and we know the rest. maybe i‚Äôm too superstitious.

donald trump calling beto o‚Äôrourke weak on borders is an insane claim. o‚Äôrourke represents his native el paso, a border town consistently ranked as one of the safest us cities.

embarrassing that ted cruz is willing to do a rally with the man who called his wife ugly and accused his dad of killing jfk. cruz has no dignity and only cares about political power. https://t.co/9ukvrmkiso

@realdonaldtrump a fourth don mcgahn tweet? seriously? what is trump hiding?

@psych_hype @realdonaldtrump don mcgahn has said he doesn‚Äôt want to end up in a cell like john dean. trump has to be nervous as hell about him cooperating with mueller.

@realdonaldtrump geez. this is already donald trump‚Äôs third tweet about don mcgahn this morning. people with nothing to hide aren‚Äôt this defensive.

@gwengraham @andrewgillum this is so classy! democratic party unity always almost brings a tear to me eye.

@realdonaldtrump trump is forcing mcsally to go full maga which will make her toxic to independents and some moderates. democrat kyrsten sinema will hand him another endorsement loss. he already knows the blue wave is coming. that's why he tossed out the rhetoric about violence today.

only donald trump could kill net neutrality and then whine about the internet being unfair.

@leftcoastbabe if all republicans end up having to pander to trump, honestly, what‚Äôs the difference?! she‚Äôll have to support batshiy crazy.

martha mcsally is a much stronger candidate than rwnjs kelli ward and joe arpaio, but democrat kyrsten sinema has been leading her in polls and can flip this senate seat blue. https://t.co/xcmvll3wpz

question about the #azprimary: do we root for mcsally, who has a decent shot of beating sinema, or do we root for arpaio or ward, who would be underdogs but way scarier if they somehow made it to the senate?

lindsey graham losing the influence of john mccain as he spends more time with golfing pal donald trump is going to be very bad for democracy. graham has gone from never trump to the senate version of devin nunes in two years time. expect him to sink even lower.

hoping that jeff flake‚Äôs endorsement of martha mcsally backfires because no way either of the crazies, kelli ward or joe arpaio, beats kyrsten sinema. would be the first time arizona elected a democrat to the us senate since 1988.

this is hypocritical. donald trump blocked me and other dissenting voters from interacting with his tweets. rigged responses to look favorable. that‚Äôs ‚Äúcontrolling what we can &amp; cannot see.‚Äù fortunately, courts made him unblock us. he blocked me 5/17. finally was unblocked today. https://t.co/forflwgwhi

kelli ward is a horrible person, but she‚Äôs not even the worst human being in the gop arizona senate primary. that dubious honor goes to joe arpaio. republican primaries are now about who‚Äôs trumpier, not who has better ideas.

understand having complicated feelings if you disliked mccain‚Äôs politics and/or hawkish foreign policy. but he was a pow for 5+ years and refused early release to show solidarity with fellow prisoners. for that alone he deserves our respect. hope everyone keeps it positive today.

in a party full of trump doormats, john mccain was more willing to stand up to the president than any other republican. his politics were almost always the opposite of mine, but you gotta respect his final chapter. if there were more like him we‚Äôd be in a better spot right now.

@real_joenathan @windmillcharger counter-counterpoint: democrats will never elect someone like trump.

@cbsnews appreciate the correction, we all make mistakes, but why didn‚Äôt you say it like this the 1st time? it shouldn‚Äôt be that hard to avoid parroting disingenuous right-wing fiction. the entire mainstream media falls for this trap way too often. please do better. america depends on it.

@zettie_geez @cbsnews see my follow-up. i was talking about cbs not beto.

so when we liberals scoff at the term ‚Äúliberal media,‚Äù stuff like this tweet by cbs news is why. the mainstream media often adopts the framing used by republicans and right-wing media instead of phrasing things in a more factual, objective way.

@kyunglahcnn @senjohnmccain tomi is a human in name only. lower than low to take shots at him on a day like today.

it's like so ridiculous that democrats think there is racism within the gop. it's not like the republican president tweeted white supremacist talking points about south africa this week or anything. https://t.co/ykdqgup6dh

@rorybwood he opposed the repeal bill in the senate largely because he wanted arizona to keep expanded medicaid. i don‚Äôt agree with him on much, again, but he does get some credit for being somewhat reasonable in a party that completely lost its mind and compassion.

@sheldonstanton9 @lucycarin @colinallredtx two of the worst ones by far. which is more than enough.

important: trumpers are trying to save pete sessions, one of the worst house republicans. support @colinallredtx. we can flip this seat blue if we fight, but this race isn't getting enough attention. allred is an excellent candidate. donate/volunteer here: https://t.co/ler8krnphz https://t.co/lfr6q1u7gm

@rorybwood well, he helped save the aca and tried to come up with a daca fix that did not include funding for the border wall. those are just two recent examples. i disagreed with him a lot, but i got to give credit where credit is due.

also sad that over the past 20 years the gop became the party of bush then trump instead of john mccain. hardly ever agreed with him, i‚Äôm a liberal and he‚Äôs a conservative, but can guarantee the us would be in a better place if republicans followed his lead instead of lesser men.

john mccain is a rare politician. a fighter almost as likely to clash with his own party as the opposition. wishing for him to find a peaceful end and hoping people have nothing but kind words to say regardless of political leanings. we owe him that for his service.

@danscavino @realdonaldtrump @secretsbedard @dcexaminer is this a joke? they have lavar ball and leonardo dicaprio listed as potential 2020 candidates. on the other hand, either would be better than what we have now.

chris cuomo says what most of america thinks about kellyanne conway right to her face: ‚Äúyou should admit he's lying, and you don't, and that's why people don't trust you.‚Äù https://t.co/qtxatfrdan

that planned parenthood vote was sneaky as hell. rand paul and the gop knew it had no shot of getting 60 votes (fell 15 short). looks like a stunt to provide roe cover for collins and murkowski if they confirm kavanaugh, and also to hurt red-state democrats right before midterms.

@jordanuhl she‚Äôs just trying to keep up with the (alex) joneses.

@jordanuhl only tomi could use a completely different distortion of facts to defend her first distortion of facts. she's like inception for right-wing morons.

it hasn't been said enough this week that sean hannity was one of michael cohen's three clients. fox news shouldn't even allow him to weigh in on this massive conflict of interest.

trump can fire sessions. he can probably fire rosenstein. he can fire lots of people. know who he can‚Äôt fire? the resistance. but we can fire him in 2020 and republicans in congress in 75 days.

@nowthisnews lindsey graham blows whichever way the wind goes like a weak palm tree in his home state. he‚Äôs a self-absorbed coward.

conservatives called michelle obama both a gorilla and a man, and chastised her for wanting to help stop childhood diabetes, but keep crying us a river over melania trump supposedly getting treated unfairly.

dan patrick is a horrible person. any texan who votes for him should be ashamed of themselves. the way right-wing america is ignoring both the overall data on undocumented immigrants and the wishes of mollie tibbetts' family and friends to weaponize her death is gross. https://t.co/ucihbviqvd

this talking point that manafort is a good man because he worked for dole and reagan is silly season. i don‚Äôt care if he worked for gandhi and mother teresa ‚Äî a crook is a crook.

@pearl313131 that was literally two decades ago and nowhere near as bad as the trump corruption and scandals. i couldn‚Äôt even vote back then.

@wyattlowe i wanted him to get primaried fwiw. hung jury made things a little harder. but i agree this is the one bad recent stain on our record.

call me crazy, but morals aside i also don‚Äôt think the democrats would be stupid enough to mortgage their permanent reputation for one piece of unpopular legislation and (maybe) two supreme court justices while allowing a cult to hijack the party.

@cynicalpuss also a lot easier to sacrifice a king than the permanent reputation of your political party. republicans even saw it that was with nixon at the end.

if donald trump was a democrat, is there any doubt that the party and its base would have already pushed him out? think about al franken. dems have adopted a zero tolerance policy for unethical behavior. tells you all you need to know about where the two parties are at morally.

orrin hatch once suggested that ken starr should name bill clinton as an "unindicted co-conspirator" in a monica lewinsky indictment. but since the president is a republican this time, even though the situation is much worse, he feels totally different. unbelievable.

@khaled74 watch your mouth! ;)

@sustainablelaf the debates haven‚Äôt even started. i don‚Äôt think this has to be a moral victory. beto can win. he seems to be creating a ton of new voters in a state with poor turnout. he‚Äôs being severely underestimated.

those of us who live in texas aren‚Äôt surprised that beto o‚Äôrourke is already down only 4 points to ted cruz. it really feels like we are witnessing this generation‚Äôs bobby kennedy come of age. the energy on the ground is insane. https://t.co/kai5gkfylg

"a desperate and pathetic attempt by democrats to obstruct a very highly qualified nominee." - sarah sanders

that‚Äôs what the senate gop did to merrick garland. dems are simply trying to stop a criminal potus from picking a justice for 30-40 years.

@therickwilson and w or l, every dem should have this guy on their radar. the frustrating thing for talented politicians like him &amp; julian castro is they would probably have a better chance of winning nationally than statewide in texas. but do they get the chance if they don‚Äôt win here first?

@theellenshow @betoorourke please put him on the show. lots of texans still don‚Äôt know about this awesome candidate.

@chelfrich i said ‚Äúappears to be‚Äù because they are still in the process of being sued and investigated, and i try to choose my words carefully, but you are right there is considerable evidence.

sarah sanders is like a talking pull-string toy with only a handful of phrases:

if squeaky clean barack obama didn‚Äôt get a hearing for a scotus nominee, a president who is an unindicted co-conspirator in felony crimes definitely shouldn‚Äôt get one. don‚Äôt back down, senate democrats. put your foot on the gop‚Äôs throat. this is now a fight you can win.

@cnnpolitics the republican party survived nixon, iran contra, george w. bush and a pedophile speaker of the house. these people don't care about morals, only winning. stop asking this question.

hey, conservatives, stop saying paul manafort‚Äôs crimes have nothing to do with trump. at the very least, trump‚Äôs judgment was so poor he hired a criminal, who has now been found guilty in a court of law, to run a presidential campaign. that‚Äôs not something you can just blow off.

@mike_p_williams everyone just needs to accept he will do/say anything to win and most republicans have adopted that mindset as well.

@molitron he‚Äôs probably won more than he‚Äôs lost but most of his wins are in safe deep-red races or primaries. the moore and saccone endorsements were particularly embarrassing.

@mike_p_williams he said it is the new democrat slogan. jfc. that base will believe anything, though, so it will work.

trump claimed andrew cuomo was talking to "a room loaded up with socialists." some idiot in the crowd yelled "communists," proving these people have no idea what socialism even is. even trump had to correct him! https://t.co/mf3mvvyzye

imagine hillary clinton‚Äôs lawyer taking a plea deal over campaign finance violations while john podesta was on trial. the same house republicans who are passionately protecting donald trump during this michael cohen/paul manafort drama would vote to impeach hrc. rank hypocrisy.

@atmostrio we were talking about single-payer, debt-free college, the environment, gun regulation, marijuana legalization... i just don‚Äôt think that is a valid argument. the democratic platform was the most progressive in party history. and bernie and hrc both deserve credit for that.

@atmostrio joe lieberman and red-state democratic senators sunk it. many democrats wanted the public option including myself. i think if liberals would‚Äôve showed up and won the 2010 election we probably could‚Äôve made the aca considerably better. but we didn‚Äôt get out the vote.

@atmostrio no politician is above criticism, but people acting like pelosi and democrats accomplished nothing is unfair. the most obvious example is getting 20 million uninsured americans coverage, including cancer survivors like my mom who might be dead without the aca.

@bitchypundit that‚Äôs unfair. i care about beating the gop. once we do that i honestly will support whoever the majority rallies around to be the next leaders. i‚Äôve just seen us lose too many elections because we couldn‚Äôt come together and focus.

@atmostrio this isn‚Äôt democracy shaming, but a request to first focus on the task at hand. it‚Äôs a moot point if dems don‚Äôt win. we should absolutely have a discussion about leadership with all factions included in that decision. but there‚Äôs no decision to make if we lose.

to david hogg and others on the left criticizing nancy pelosi: now is not the time. if we don‚Äôt win this election there will be no debate over who should be the democratic speaker. let‚Äôs suspend the infighting long enough to win the midterms. then we can have that conversation.
